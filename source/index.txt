Datavyu is a complete software package for visualizing and coding
behavioral observations from video data sources. Designed
by - and for - behavioral scientists, Datavyu facilitates data
coding and sharing through the ongoing `Databrary <http://databrary.org/>`_
data library project.

.. note:: 

   Datavyu is an open source software package.
   You should familiarize yourself with previous
   version's `release notes <http://datavyu.org/download/>`_, to be
   aware of each version's features and potential issues. If you encounter a bug, you can report
   it and get help by posting to the `support forum
   <http://datavyu.org/support>`_.

In addition to the powerful software package, Datavyu provides a
Ruby-based API to help you automate common tasks and ensure accuracy
in your data. The API greatly enhances
the Datavyu experience, and is well worth the effort of learning some
programming fundamentals.

When you are ready to start using Datavyu, the following chapters
outline everything you need to know to become an expert Datavyu user,
from first principles to advanced strategies.
