Datavyu is a complete software package for visualizing and collecting
behavioral observations from audio and video data sources. Designed
by - and for - behavioral scientists, Datavyu facilitates data
collection and sharing through the ongoing `Databrary <http://databrary.org/>`_
data library project.

.. note:: 

   Datavyu is an open source software package that is under continuous
   development. You should familiarize yourself with each new
   version's `release notes <http://datavyu.org/download/>`_, to be
   aware of potental issues. If you encounter a bug, you can report
   and discuss it and get help by posting to the `support forum
   <http://datavyu.org/support>`_.

In addition to the powerful software package, Datavyu provides a
Ruby-based API to help you automate common tasks and ensure accuracy
during data collection by writing scripts. The API greatly enhances
the Datavyu experience, and is well worth the effort of learning some
programming fundamentals.

When you are ready to start using Datavyu, the following chapters
outline everything you need to know to become an expert Datavyu user,
from first principles to advanced strategies.
