First Steps in Behavioral Coding
================================

For a beginner setting out to code behavioral data for the first time,
or a more experienced coder that's new to Datavyu, figuring out where
to start can be daunting. This tutorial presents a process that helps
you to set yourself up for success, and guides you through the steps
necessary to start coding behavioral data with Datavyu.

The general process involves familiarizing yourself with your data
source and creating a coding scheme that coders will use to code data
from those experiments. Next, you should test your coding scheme,
determine how you will analyze the data you collect and ensure that your
coding scheme supports your export needs. Finally, you can start coding.
The following sections go through each step in detail.

.. important:: 

   This tutorial describes an ideal way to start coding
   your behavioral data from video. Regardless of the process you follow,
   **do not** code hours of video before verifying that your coding scheme
   is reliable, and **do not** score hours of video before ensuring
   that you can export the data in a format that works for your
   statistical analysis.

Set the Scene
-------------

Start by watching the video in real time. Take detailed notes about what
you are seeing, so that you can refer to your observations when you
start planning your coding scheme.

Then, watch representative portions of video (perhaps 2-3 minutes) from
several participants and, again, take notes, recording similarities and
differences. 

Watching videos from a variety of study participants 
prevents you from basing your coding scheme on one individual, and 
discovering that their trial was unrepresentative of the study
participants in general. 

Create Your Coding Manual
-------------------------

1. Determine what your :ref:`columns` will be.

2. Tentatively create :term:`codes <code>` for each column. 

   See: :ref:`develop-coding-manual` for advice on choosing and
   defining codes, and for creating a coding manual in general. For help
   setting up your spreadsheet see:
   :doc:`/guide/tutorials/configure-datavyu-codes` and
   :doc:`/guide/spreadsheet`.

Test Your Plan
--------------

Test your coding scheme by coding representative portions of video
for several participants. As you code, keep the following questions
in mind:

- Is this *easy* to do? 

- Is this *reliable*? Do I have the codes I need to record
  my observations for all participants? Do I have the columns I need?

If you answered 'no' to either question, you need to revise your scheme.
Developing a coding scheme can take practice and iterations, but the
work spent developing the scheme and manual is more than made up for
during the coding process.

If things went well for you, ask a colleague to score the same data
sources using your coding scheme. This helps ensure that your manual is
clear to other people, and that your work is reproducible. See:
:ref:`api-reliability` for a guide to creating reliability columns
and testing for consistency between coders.

If your colleague had difficulties working with your scheme, again,
you need to revise it, and start testing again.

Plan for Analysis
-----------------

Collecting data is great, but it won't be useful if you can't analyze it.
At this point, you need to ensure that your data is in a format that
you can use, and that you have a way to export that data. This task
involves two components:

- Ensure that the codes that you are using will be useful when it comes
  to analyzing your data. Do you have the codes you need for the study
  you're performing? Are they in a useful format (e.g. single
  characters, numeric, etc.)?
  
- Ensure that you can *export* your data in a format that is useful. If
  Datavyu's direct CSV export results in a file format that you cannot
  use, you will need to :ref:`write a script to export the data
  <api-export-data>`.
 
You should know how you are going to analyze your data, and how you are
going to export it before you progress any further. Export your test
coding passes and see if they work with your stats software. If the
formatting isn't suitable, or you can't work with the codes you've
developed, once again, you'll need to revise your plan.

When you're satisfied that you can export and analyze your data,
you're ready to move on to the next stage.

.. _use-a-template:

Implement Your Plan
-------------------

Now that you have a functioning coding scheme and manual, and have a plan
for exporting and analyzing your data, you can start coding.

#. Start by creating a blank template file containing your study
   columns, configured with the codes you have chosen. Use this template
   for every participant and pass: open it and create a new file for
   each pass using Save As. This ensures that data collection is
   consistent within an experiment.

#. Code a participant's trial using your new template.

#. :doc:`Write a script </api/tutorials/check-for-coding-errors>` to
   check your first coding pass for typos, impossible relations, and out
   of range values. For consistency, use these scripts to check all
   passes in this experiment.

Next Steps
----------

You're now all set to collect the data from your sources. Remember
to check for typos and coding errors after each pass, and consider
using :ref:`reliablity coding <api-reliability>` to double check
your data quality.

The Best Practices :ref:`In Depth Guides <in-depth>` are a great next
step: they provide detailed guidance and insight into best practices
for particular types of data, as well as recommendations for how to
organize your files.
