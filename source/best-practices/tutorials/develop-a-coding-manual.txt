Develop a Coding Manual
=======================

Developing a coding manual is an essential step when starting to
collect data for an experiment. In any study, it is important that
you determine how you are going to collect your data. The coding manual
formalizes your strategy, detailing what data you will collect, and how.

At its core, a coding manual simply formalizes the practices you've
decided to use to collect data, and answers a variety of questions:

- What :term:`columns <column>` are you going to have?  
- What :term:`codes <code>` will each column include?  
- How will you define each code?  
- What are valid values, and what do these values mean?  
- How will you determine :term:`onsets <onset>` and :term:`offsets <offset>`?

Defining each code, value, and column makes it easy to return to a
study weeks, months, or years later, and understand what the codes
refer to. It also gives coders a resource from which to work, ensuring
that each coder collects data in the same way. While this takes work,
and often requires numerous iterations to "get right", the initial
effort is well worth it in the long run.

Choose Columns 
--------------

Datavyu's :term:`columns <column>` are the highest level grouping for
data. It makes sense, therefore, to start by determining what your
columns should be, based on your data source and experiment.

One common column structure is to create columns that contain metadata
for the experiment: participant information and trial information, for
example. The following spreadsheet shows an "*id*" column
that has participant information, a "*trial*" column that has
information for each trial, and columns for specific observations. The
*id* column's :term:`cell` is the full length of the spreadsheet,
since all the trials are associated with that participant. The *trial*
column's cells are the length of each trial, and the other observation
columns' cells reflect the durations of
the recorded events.

For less structured data, as in :download:`the example video </resources/DatavyuSampleVideo.mov>`
this structure isn't necessary, but choosing columns that
represent phenomena you care about remains a key priority. In the following spreadsheet example, there are columns for
the mother and baby's speech, what object they are holding, location,
notes, etc.

Choose Codes and Possible Values
--------------------------------

:term:`Codes <code>` represent the phenomena that you are observing. 
Descriptions of each column's codes and their possible values are the
bulk of the coding manual. When determining your codes, there are
differing goals to bear in mind:

- Frame-by-frame coding is time-consuming. If it is
  necessary, coders will be happier and more efficient if they can
  proceed through the data source without having to backtrack.

- Coding column-by-column is often efficient, and allows coders to
  focus on specific phenomena, and move through the video quickly.
  To code multiple columns in this way, however, the coder will need
  to watch the data source multiple times.

- Categorical codes are easy to code: if a coder sees a behavior in
  the course of coding another event, there is little cost to them
  coding that behavior. Coding many phenomena simultaneously , however,
  can slow the coder down.

The way you configure your columns and codes will vary depending on your
data and experiment, and you will likely need to iterate on your plan
before finding an ideal scheme. Regardless of your particular
experiment, the following practices will help you as you develop your
coding scheme and manual.

Use Consistent Naming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When naming columns and codes, use consistent naming across subjects
and files within the same study. 

For instance, if you have fifteen participants in a study, the columns
and codes you use when coding each participant's trial should have the
same names and follow the same coding scheme. In addition, if you have
multiple similar studies, consistent nomenclature can make it easier for
coders to code those phenomena efficiently, and potentially provide
opportunity to compare data between studies.

Avoid Repetitive Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your coding scheme requires you to repeatedly input the same value for large
blocks of cells, you should consider an alternate way to represent
that code. 

For instance, if you had a *trial* column that had the trial number,
trial date, and participant information (participant ID, gender, and
birthdate) as codes, it would be onerous to have to repeatedly code the
same participant information. In this case, moving participant data into
its own column, with a single cell containing that information,
will reduce the likelihood of coder errors and save coder time.

.. figure:: /img/coding-manual-nested-columns-example-with-no-id-col.png
   :alt: Screenshot of spreadsheet with two columns: trial (which includes participant information in its codes) and step

   In this spreadsheet, the participant information (``1080, f, 
   1/2/10``) is repeated in every *trial* cell. This creates extra
   work for the coder, and increases the potential for an input error
   that could cause problems during analysis.

Choose "Quick" Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Coding is a time-intensive task: choose code values that are 
quick to code to expedite the process. 

For instance, if you are
coding a video with someone walking, you might have a *step*
column, with codes like "foot", referring to the left or right foot,
and "direction", referring to the direction of motion. If the coder
has to type "left", "right", "forward", and "backward" repeatedly,
coding is going to be time consuming and the potential for typos
is high.

Instead, choose values that are short: one character is often a good
choice. So instead of typing "left", the coder would input "l", "r"
for "right", "f" for "forward" and "b" for "backward. This way, the
coder can speed through quickly, typing one or two keystrokes rather
than five or ten. It is also easier to see potential input errors
with fewer characters. Part of the role of the coding manual is to
record what these values mean, so that researchers can come back to
the data in the future and understand the input values.

Sample Coding Manual
--------------------

Each researcher will have their own preferred coding manual format,
and determining what works best for you is part of getting started.
This manual was developed by the creators of Datavyu for one of
their experiments, and is a good starting point for creating your
own coding manual.
