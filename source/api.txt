Datavyu Ruby API
================

The Datavyu scripting API provides a scriptable interface to Datavyu's
database, allowing you to manipulate your data, print in any format
you'd like, or check your data for errors.

   [Temporary caption] We'll replace this imgae with one that uses the
   sample data source and codes once I receive it.

If you're new to programming or new to Ruby, you might want to go
through the `Basic Ruby Tutorial
<https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/>`_.  Once
you're ready to start working with Ruby Scripts, see:
:doc:`/api/introduction-to-scripting` for a Datavyu-specific overview
of the Ruby API and scripting for Datavyu.
