Datavyu Ruby API
================

The Datavyu scripting API provides a scriptable interface to Datavyu's
database, allowing you to manipulate your data, print in any format
you'd like, or check your data for errors.

If you're new to programming or new to Ruby, you might want to go
through the `Basic Ruby Tutorial <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/>`_. Once you're
ready to start working with Ruby Scripts, see:
:doc:`/api/write-ruby-scripts-for-datavyu` for a Datavyu-specific overview of
the Ruby API and scripting for Datavyu.
