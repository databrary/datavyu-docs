Ruby API

The Datavyu scripting API provides a scriptable interface to Datavyu's
database, allowing you to manipulate your data, print in any format
you'd like, or check your data for errors.

   sample data source and codes once I receive it.

Getting Started with APIs and Scripting
---------------------------------------

APIs, Application Program Interfaces, are collections of code that
specify how software components communicate with each other. Datavyu's
API is in the Ruby programming language, an object-oriented language
that has become incredibly popular over the last decade. Ruby is
reasonably easy to learn, and novice programmers can start writing
scripts with minimal programming knowledge.

Before you dive into the :doc:`/api/tutorials`, though, you should
familiarize yourself with :doc:`what an API is
</api/introduction-to-apis>`, learn about Ruby's :term:`classes
<class>` and :term:`methods <method>` and how they differ, and
follow the :doc:`/api/introduction-to-scripting`.

Core Documentation
------------------

The Datavyu Ruby API's core documentation is organized into tutorials
and reference pages. Tutorials provide step-by-step instructions for
accomplishing common tasks with Ruby scripts. The Reference
documentation provides a detailed reference for every :term:`class`
and :term:`method` included in the API. This can be useful if you are
uncertain about how to use a specific method, or want an example of
its use.
