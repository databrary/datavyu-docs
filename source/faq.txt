General
-------

What is Datavyu used for?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Datavyu is a video coding and data visualization tool for collecting
behavioral data from video. 

Can I use Datavyu to analyze data?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Datavyu is a data collection tool, not a statistical analysis tool. You
can export data from Datavyu in a variety of forms depending on your
analysis needs. See the :ref:`basic export <guide-export-data>` and
:ref:`scripting export <api-export-data>` tutorials for more information.

In the future, Datavyu will include support for scripting using R.

What video formats does Datavyu support?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Datavyu supports all video formats that Quicktime or VLC can play,
including .asf, .wmv, .avi, .flv, .mov, .mpf, .ogg, .mpg, .nsc, .wav,
and .dts.

Can I code sources that are not videos?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No, Datavyu does not currently support non-video data sources. Support
for other data sources is planned for a future release.

Is there somewhere I can share or store my spreadsheets and videos?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes indeed! `Databrary <databrary.org>`_ is a web-based repository for
open sharing and preservation of video data and associated metadata. The
project website has more information about the initiative and a guide
to help you get started.

Do I have to pay for Datavyu?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No! Datavyu is completely free and open source. If you would like to
contribute to the development of Datavyu, see: `the source on GitHub
<https://github.com/databrary/datavyu>`_.

Technical Requirements
----------------------

Which operating system is Datavyu available for?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Datavyu builds are available for both Windows and Mac OS X. You can
download either version from `the Datavyu Downloads page <http://datavyu.org/download/>`_.

In the future, Datavyu will also provide a Linux version.

Do I need any additional software to run Datavyu?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Datavyu requires Java, and either Quicktime or VLC. See:
:ref:`datavyu-requirements` for more details.

What hardware do I need to code data sources in Datavyu?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Datavyu makes extensive use of a the keypad for controlling video
playback. If your keyboard does not have a keypad (for example, if
you're working on a laptop), you will need to acquire an external keypad.

Beyond that, there are no specific hardware requirements.

Do I need to be connected to the internet when using Datavyu?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No! Datavyu runs entirely on your computer. If you are connected to the
internet, however, Datavyu will check to see if there is a new version
of Datavyu that you can download. See: :ref:`update-datavyu` for more
information.

Support
-------

I've never coded video data before. How should I start?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :doc:`best practices guide </best-practices>` is an excellent
resource to help you start coding behavioral data from video.

Where can I learn to use Datavyu?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :doc:`Datavyu user guide </guide>` provides comprehensive
documentation of Datavyu's interfaces and capabilities, as well as
tutorials to guide you through common tasks.

I'm not sure how to best code my data? Are there guidelines for coding?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :doc:`best practices guide </best-practices>` provides
in-depth instructions and suggestions for coding your behavioral data.
In particular, check out :ref:`coding-manual` and :ref:`first-steps`.

How do I update Datavyu?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you first start up Datavyu while connected to the internet, Datavyu
automatically checks for new versions and prompts you to update if there
is a new version. See: :ref:`update-datavyu` for more information.

Where can I ask questions about issues I'm having with Datavyu?

API Scripts
-----------

What is a script?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A script is a collection of code that performs actions on a file or
spreadsheet. You could write a script to add a column, add codes to a
column, duplicate and move data around, or export data to a convenient
file format for analysis with SPSS, for example. See the :doc:`Ruby API
guide </api>` for more information.


I'm not a programmer - where can I learn to write scripts?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :doc:`Ruby API guide </api>` provides an in-depth
introduction to scripting with Datavyu's Ruby API, tutorials that guide
you through common scripting tasks and detailed method reference for
each API component, to help you learn how these components work
together. 

If you're completely unfamiliar with programming, going through the Ruby
language's `Learn Ruby in Twenty Minutes
<https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/>`_ tutorial may
be helpful. Ruby is an easy-to-read programming language which was
designed to be intuitive and easy to learn, so gaining the basics should
be very feasible.

What can I use scripts for?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can write scripts to import, manipulate, and export data. The
:ref:`API tutorials <api-tutorials>` describe common tasks you can write
scripts to accomplish.

MacSHAPA and OpenSHAPA
----------------------

.. I have existing MacSHAPA files - can I convert my them to Datavyu?
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Yes! You can import a MacSHAPA file into Datavyu through a simple
   script using the :meth:`load_macshapa_db()`.

I have existing OpenSHAPA files - can I convert them to Datavyu?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes! You can open your OpenSHAPA files in Datavyu like you would any
other Datavyu file.

Will my MacSHAPA queries work in Datayvyu?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unfortunately, MacSHAPA queries do not work on the new Datavyu format.
You will need to write new scripts for your Datavyu spreadsheets.

Will my OpenSHAPA scripts run in Databyu?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes…ish. You can easily convert an OpenSHAPA script to work in Datavyu
by adding ``require 'Datavyu_API.rb`` to the top of your OpenSHAPA
script file. For more information see the
:ref:`api-convert-openshapa-to-datavyu` tutorial.
