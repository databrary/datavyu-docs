Welcome to Datavyu's Best Practices guide. [words about coding
behavioral data from video here].

If you're brand new to coding behavioral data from video, check out our
:ref:`new-users`. The :ref:`intro <new-users>` pages are a high level
guide to the kinds of questions you should be asking when starting to
work with behavioral data, and provides some general tips to make the
process more accessible. If you've never coded before, you should start
here.

Once you've thought things through, and are ready to start coding a
video, you may be wondering how to get started. The :ref:`first-steps`
section answers these questions, and will help you get up and running.

For those of you looking for tips and tricks to improve your process,
consider the :ref:`in-depth` section, which groups together in-depth
guides for developing coding manuals, organizing your Datavyu files, and
specific recommendations for coding different types of data.
