guide to the kinds of questions you should be asking when starting to
work with behavioral data, and provides some general tips to make the
process more accessible. If you've never coded before, you should start

section answers these questions, and will help you get up and running.

For those of you looking for tips and tricks to improve your process,
consider the :ref:`in-depth` section, which groups together in-depth
