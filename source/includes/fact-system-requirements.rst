Hardware Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These hardware requirements are the minimum needed for Datavyu: more RAM
or a faster processor will improve Datavyu's performance, especially when
working with higher-resolution data sources.

- Java 1.6 or higher.
- 1GB of RAM.
- 1.2 GHz processor.

You will also need enough disk space for the videos that you will be
working with, and a keypad, either as part of your keyboard, or as an
external device.

Software Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Datavyu is a Java-based application. Many operating systems include
Java by default, but if you have *not* installed Java, you should do
so prior to installing Datavyu.
