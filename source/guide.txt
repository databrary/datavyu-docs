Datavyu is a Java-based application that runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux
operating systems. Its primary goal is to link behavioral researchers
with their video, audio, or other data sources, and to provide a way for
researchers to record their observations, extract their data for
analysis, and share their work. Using a spreadsheet template that
specifies which categories of events youâ€™re interested in coding,
Datavyu enables researchers to record events or build on prior analyses.

This guide provides all the information you need to start using Datavyu,
starting with installation instructions, through an in-depth description
of the software components, to a series of tutorials that target common
operations with Datavyu. The reference section lists terms and
definitions, as well as detailing any file format requirements and
limitations.

If you're new to coding, or want to bone up on advice from the experts,
consider the :doc:`Best Practices Guide </best-practices>` for
instruction on how best to harness Datavyu's capabilities,
and tips for starting to code behavioral videos.
