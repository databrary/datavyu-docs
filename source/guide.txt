Datavyu is a Java-based application that runs on Windows, Mac, and on Linux
operating systems. Its primary goal is to link behavioral researchers
with their video and to provide a way for researchers 
to record their observations, extract their data for
analysis, and share their work. Using a spreadsheet template that
specifies which categories of events youâ€™re interested in coding,
Datavyu enables researchers to record events and build on prior analyses.

This guide provides all the information you need to start using Datavyu,
with installation instructions, an in-depth description
of the software components, and a series of tutorials that target common
operations. The reference section lists terms and
