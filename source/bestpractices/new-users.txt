Introduction for New Users
==========================

You need to think about a bunch of things before you start collecting
behavioral data from video. If you plow forth and start coding without
developing a plan, thinking about the ways you will be analyzing the
data (and thus, what sorts of data you will need), you may find yourself
hours later with data you cannot use, and hours wasted. Worse yet, you
might contentedly collect your data, and go back to analyze it weeks
or months later, and realize that you have no idea what your codes mean.

Thankfully, it's not difficult to start with one's best foot forward.

Develop a Coding Scheme and Manual
----------------------------------

This is perhaps the most important [thing] you should do. A coding
scheme describes what data you are going to collect and how to collect
it. This helps you ensure that you collect data that will enable you to
perform the analyses you wish to perform. A coding manual documents the
scheme in detail, so that future coders will be able to reproduce your
work, using the same codes for the same phenomena, following the same
timing conventions, etc.

The manual is also helpful during analysis, as it defines what each
code describes, and how those observations were determined. This can be
invaluable for researchers who might be analyzing their data months or years
after its collection, and supports reuse and sharing of data for novel
purposes.

You download an example of a coding manual from:
:download:`resources/example-coding-manual.pdf`. To learn about
developing a coding manual, see: :ref:`develop-coding-manual`.

Start Simple
------------

When faced with a complex data source, it might be tempting to start
trying to code everything. This can result in [stuff].

Instead, start simple. You can code in passes, going :term:`column` by
column until you have collected all the data from a trial or
participant. While minimizing the need to repeatedly watch a video
source is also a consideration, if you're first starting out, coding
column-by-column helps ensure that you don't miss things, and gives you
more time to become comfortable working with the Datavyu interface.

Consider Analysis
-----------------

While this is something you should think about while developing your
coding scheme, it bears reminding to ensure that the data you collect
supports your analyses. You should think about how you want your data
to look when you analyze it, and how you're going to export the
data from Datavyu. If your coding scheme is not going to provide you
with the data you want in a format you can work with, you need to rethink
the scheme.

Many Datavyu users :doc:`write scripts </api>` to help them export their
data in an ideal format that analyze using statistics packages like
SPSS. Your own use case should determine how you prepare with your data.

Next Steps
----------

With a basic grounding in working with behavioral data, you're ready
to follow through the :ref:`first-steps` tutorial. You can also refer
to :doc:`the Datavyu Software Guide </guide>` for a refresher on the
Datavyu software package itself.
