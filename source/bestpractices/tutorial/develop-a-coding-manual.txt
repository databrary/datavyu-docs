Develop a Coding Manual
=======================

Developing a coding manual is an essential step when starting to
collect data from an experiment. In any study, it is important that
you determine how you data is going to be collected, and the coding
manual is the document that defines what data you will collect, and
how it will be collected.

At its core, a coding manual simply formalizes the practices you've
decided to use to collect data, and answers a variety of questions:

- What :term:`columns <column>` are you going to have?  
- What :term:`codes <code>` will each column include?  
- How are these codes going to be defined?  
- What are valid values, and what do these values mean?  
- How will :term:`onsets <onset>` and :term:`offsets <offset>` be determined?

Defining each code, value, and column makes it easy to return to a
study weeks, months, or years later, and understand what the codes
refer to. It also gives coders a resource from which to work, ensuring
that each coder collects data in the same way. While this takes work,
and often requires numerous iterations to "get right", the initial
effort is well worth it in the long run.

Choose Columns 
--------------

Datavyu's :term:`columns <column>` are the highest level grouping for
data. It makes sense, therefore, to start by determining what your
columns should be, based on your data source and experiment.

One common column structure is to create columns that contain metadata
for the experiment: participant information and trial information, for
instance. The following spreadsheet example shows an "*id*" column
that has participant information, a "*trial*" column that has
information for each trial, and columns for specific observations. The
*id* column's :term:`cell` is the full length of the spreadsheet,
since all the trials are associated with that participant. The *trial*
column's cells are the length of each trial, and the other observation
columns' cells are of various lengths, according to the durations of
the recorded events.

For less structured data, as in [the example video / spreadsheet],
this structure might not be as necessary, but choosing columns that
represent phenomena you care about remains the key priority. For
instance, in the following spreadsheet example, there are columns for
the mother and baby's speech, what object they are holding, location,
notes, etc.

Choose Codes and Possible Values
--------------------------------

:term:`Codes <code>` represent the phenomena that you are observing. 
Descriptions of each column's codes and their possible values are the
bulk of the coding manual. When determining your codes, there are
several goals to bear in mind:

- Frame-by-frame coding is extremely time-consuming. If it is
  necessary, coders will be happier and more efficient if they can
  proceed through the data source without having to backtrack.

- Coding column-by-column is often efficient, and allows coders to
  focus on specific phenomena, and move through the video quickly.
  To code multiple columns in this way, however, the coder will need
  to go through the data source multiple times.

- Categorical codes are easy to code: if a coder sees a behavior in
  the course of coding another event, there is little cost to them
  coding that behavior. Coding too many phenemna at once time, however,
  can slow the coder down.

In the end, it is up to you to determine the best approach for your
specific use case. If you are coding frame-by-frame, as in an
eye tracking study, you might favor a different approach than coding
the mother and baby's interaction in [the sample video], where
creating cells for movement, speech, and objects as you go through
the video would be tricky (and inefficient). The way you configure
your columns and codes will vary depending on your use case. Regardless,
there are several practices that will help you as you develop your
coding scheme and manual.

Use Consistent Naming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When naming columns and codes, use consistent naming across subjects
and files within the same study. For instance, if you have fifteen
participants in a given study, the columns and codes you use when
coding each participant's trial should have the same names and valid
values. This is perhaps obvious: the concept of a Coding Manual is
designed to support this goal. However, if you have multiple similar
(but distinct) studies, using consistent nomenclature can make it
easier for coders to code those phenomena efficiently.

Avoid Repetitive Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your coding scheme requires you to input the same value for large
blocks of cells, you should consider an alternate way to represent
that code. For instance, if you had a *trial* column that had the
trial ID, trial date, and participant information (participant ID,
gender, and birthdate) as codes, it would be onerous to have to
repeatedly code the same participant information repeatedly throughout
a data source. Extracting that data into its own column and creating
one cell to represent a participant would  be more efficient and
reduce the likelihood of coder errors as they repeatedly input the
same information.

   :alt: Screenshot of spreadsheet with two columns: trial (which includes participant information in its codes) and step

   In this spreadsheet, the participant information (``1080, f, 
   1/2/10``) is repeated in every *trial* cell. This creates extra
   work for the coder, and increases the potential for an input error
   that could cause problems during analysis.

Choose "Quick" Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Coding is a time-intensive task, but choosing code values that are 
quick to code can expedite the process. For instance, if you are
coding a video that observed someone walking, you might have a *step*
column, with codes like "foot", referring to the left or right foot,
and "direction", referring to the direction of motion. If the coder
has to type "left", "right", "forward", and "backward" repeatedly,
coding is going to take a long time. They're also more likely to
make a typo, rendering the data difficult to analyze programmatically.

Instead, choose values that are short: one character is often a good
choice. So instead of typing "left", the coder would input "l", "r"
for "right", "f" for "forward" and "b" for "backward. This way, the
coder can speed through quickly, typing one or two keystrokes rather
than five or ten. It is also easier to see potential input errors
with fewer characters. Part of the role of the coding manual is to
record what these values mean, so that researchers can come back to
the data in the future and understand the input values.

Sample Coding Manual
--------------------

Each researcher will have their own preferred coding manual format,
and determining what works best for you is part of getting started.
This manual was developed by the creators of Datavyu for one of
their experiments, and is a good starting point for creating your
own coding manual. [Link to coding manual.]
