Datavyu File Organization
=========================

Coding data from video can be a time-consuming pursuit: it is
important, therefore, to ensure that you are able to locate and access
the spreadsheets and data files you collect. Using consistent naming,
:ref:`creating spreadsheets from experiment-specific templates
<use-a-template>`, and [something else] are good first steps, but you
should also think about how you are going to organize your files on disk.

Whether you are an experienced user, have yet to settle on an
organizational system, or who are just starting out, consider the
following tips when determining an effective file system.

One Spreadsheet Per Data Source
-------------------------------

Creating a single spreadsheet for each data source is extremely
important and has numerous benefits: 

- keeping all related data together avoids losing or
  misplacing data for a given data source,

- keeping all data for a data source facilitates analysis of that
  data, such as :ref:`api-reliability` and
  :ref:`api-check-for-typos`,

- ensuring that each spreadsheet contains data from a single data
  source helps researchers and coders refer to the data source quickly
  and easily.

Store Video Files in One Location
---------------------------------

Endeavor to store all your data sources in one location: a remote
drive, perhaps, or a specified folder. Keeping all video files
together makes it easier for coders to locate video files, and avoids
having data sources in a variety of disparate locations that
researchers will then have to search for or potentially lose.

Using some form of backup to back up data files and spreadsheets is,
as always when working with computers, also a good idea.

Link Data Sources to Corresponding Spreadsheets
-----------------------------------------------

When you add a data source to a spreadsheet using the :guilabel:`Add
Data...` button in the Data Viewer Controller, Datavyu links the data
source to that spreadsheet. When you reopen the spreadsheet days or
weeks later, Datavyu knows where to look for the data source, and will
open it for you. This makes it easier to return to your data and
understand the context and situation, and also saves time for coders
who would otherwise have to keep adding and re-syncing video sources.

If you move a data source file into a new folder or onto a different
hard drive, Datavyu will not be able to automatically locate and open
the file. You will need to re-add the data source using the Data
Viewer Controller's :guilabel:`Add Data...` button.
