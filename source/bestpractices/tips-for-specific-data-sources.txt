Coding Tips for Data Types
==========================

Coding behavioral data with Datavyu follows a consistent pattern:
create cells that delineate the behavior or event your are observing,
and record those observations. Nevertheless, here are some suggestions
for ways to approach coding specific types of data.

Eye Tracking
------------

Coding eye tracking data requires its own approach that varies
slightly from other coding. Since coders need to record each eye
movement, you should code eye tracking data *frame-by-frame* using the
:guilabel:`jog` key to slowly advance the video one frame at a
time. Frame-by-frame coding gives the coder the opportunity to code
all relevant data for a frame as they travel through the source. This
prevents the coder from having to watch the video multiple times,
which can be particularly lengthy when watching frame by frame.

Categorical
-----------

Unlike eye tracking data, categorical data, such as [examples] is easy
to code. If a coder sees a behavior in the course of coding another
event, there is little extra cost to scoring it. When designing your
coding manual, and choosing how to code your data sources, consider
ways to expedite the process by having the coder record categorical
data while recording something more time consuming.
