Before You Start

Sample Data
-----------

Most of the following tutorials use :download:`Example-Template.opf
</resources/Example-Template.opf>` as their basic data file. 

The example template contains two :term:`columns <column>`: "id",
whose [codes] describe basic information such as subject number,
test date, birth date, and condition, and "trial", which has two
[codes]: *trialnum* and *outcome*.

The example has one :term:`cell` in the "id" column, and no cells
in the "trial" column. Most of the Datavyu tutorials use the example
template as their basis, so if you want to follow along directly,
you can download it, and then open it with Datavyu (using File >
Open and selecting the file from your hard drive).

Most Datavyu scripts begin by loading a column from Datavyu using the
:meth:`getColumn()` method. Before moving on to the larger tutorial
list, you should familiarize yourself with loading Datavyu columns.

Load Datavyu Columns
--------------------

Most scripts begin by loading the desired Datavyu columns using the
:meth:`getColumn()` method. :meth:`getColumn()` takes one
argument: the name of the column in Datavyu, and returns the Ruby
representation of the column, which you can work with.

The following script retrieves the "trial" column from the Datavyu
spreadsheet and assigns it to an :class:`RVariable` object called ``trial``.

.. code-block:: ruby

   require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
   begin
      # Assign the Datavyu variable "trial" data to a new Ruby variable called trial.
     
      trial = getColumn("trial")
   end

The left side of the method call is the name of the Ruby object;
the "trial" in the parentheses is the argument passed to
:meth:`getColumn` (the name of the Datavyu variable).

Now that you're familiar with the sample data and know how to acquire
data from Datavyu, you're ready to start scripting. The following
tutorials will guide you through common tasks. If you would prefer, you
can go through the full tutorial from start to finish in
