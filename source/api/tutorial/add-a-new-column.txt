Much like adding :ref:`a cell <api-add-cells>` or :ref:`an
argument <api-add-arguments>`, the Datavyu API allows you to create a
completely new column using the :meth:`createVariable` method.
:meth:`createVariable` takes at least two parameters: the name of the
new column must come first, while any subsequent parameters become the
new column's :term:`codes <code>`.

For example, suppose you wanted to add a column called "step" to your
spreadsheet. "step" needs three arguments: *foot*, *ht*, and
*direction*.

#. Set up the script, and create a new column with its four [codes].
   You will need to create a Ruby object to  will hold the
   data until you are ready to write it back to the Database. In
   this example, the Ruby object is called ``step``:

   .. code-block:: ruby
   
      require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
      begin
         # Create new variable
         step = createVariable("step", "foot", "ht", "direction")

#. Write the new column back to the database and ``end`` the script:
   
   .. code-block:: ruby
   
      require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
      begin
         step = createVariable("step", "foot", "ht", "direction")

         # Write the new variable to Datavyu's database.
         setVariable(step)
      end

.. end-content
