==================
Add a New Variable
==================

.. begin-content

Much like adding a new cell or a new argument, Datavyu API allows you
to add a completely new variable using the :function:`createVariable()` function.

:function:`createVariable` takes at least two parameters: the first is
the name of the new variable, and any subsequent parameters are :term:`arguments`
to be added to that variable.

For example, suppose you wanted to make a variable called "step" with
the three arguments called "foot", "ht", and "direction".

#. Start the script, and create the new variable with its four arguments:

   .. code-block:: ruby
   
      require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
      begin
         step = createVariable("step", "foot", "ht", "direction")

#. Write the new variable back to the database as a new variable
   without any cells:
   
   .. code-block:: ruby
   
      setVariable(step)

Or, putting it all together:

.. code-block:: ruby

   require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
   begin
      step = createVariable("step", "foot", "ht", "direction")
      setVariable(step)
   end

.. end-content
