=================================================
Convert an OpenShapa Script to the Datavyu Format
=================================================

.. default-domain:: rb

If you have previously written scripts for use with OpenShapa or
MacShapa, you can easily reuse them with Datavyu by adding a short
line of code.

Datavyu's Ruby API was designed to interoperate with the earlier
formats, so you need simply add the following line of code to the
beginning of your script:

.. code-block:: ruby

   require 'Datavyu_API.rb'

And with that, you should be good to run your existing OpenSHAPA
scripts through Datavyu.
