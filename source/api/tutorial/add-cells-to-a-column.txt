Add Cells to a Column
=====================

Pre-populating a Datavyu column with :term:`cells <cell>` is another
common task that you can use scripts to automate.

Suppose that you are setting up a spreadsheet, and you know that there
are five trials in your data source, that occur at minute 0, minute 1,
minute 2, minute 3, and minute 4. In order to make it easier for the
coder to code the trials, you can create a blank cell for each trial,
with the :term:`onset` set to the correct trial start time.

#. Set up the script, and load the Datavyu column you will be working
   with into a Ruby variable. We'll call it ``trial`` here, but you can
   call it whatever you want to:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
      begin
         # Load the Datavyu column
         trial = getVariable("trial")

#. Create the five cells using a loop. 
   
   .. admonition:: Programming 101
   
      **Loops** are types of code that tell Ruby to do something multiple
      times. Let's break down the ``for`` loop from the following
      example for those who aren't familiar with loops:
   
      .. code-block:: ruby

         for i in 0..4
            <do stuff>
         end
   
      Essentially, this says, "for ``i`` = 0, <do stuff>, Then, for
      ``i`` = 1, <do stuff>. Then for ``i`` = 2, for ``i`` = 3, and for
      ``i`` = 4. Once you've done i = 4, stop doing stuff." The ``0..4``
      represents "from 0 to 4, inclusive".
      
      If you wanted to do something ten times, your loop could read
      ``for i in 0..9`` or ``for i in 1..10``, or ``for i in 99..108``.

      In this case, you will use the value of ``i`` to set the
      :term:`onset` time of each cell, so having it start at 0 and go to
      4 makes sense.
   
   Loop 5 times from 0 to 4, calculating the :term:`onset` time to
   set for each new cell. 
   
   a. Since Datavyu API uses times in milliseconds,
      convert ``i`` (the minute marker) to milliseconds:

      .. code-block:: ruby
   
         require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
         begin
            trial = getVariable("trial")

            for i in 0..4
               # Calculate the onset time in milliseconds
               time = i * 1000 * 60

   #. Then, create the new cell using :meth:`make_new_cell()` and
      store the cell as a Ruby object. For simplicity, we'll call it
      '``cell``:

      .. code-block:: ruby
   
         require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
         begin
            trial = getVariable("trial")

            for i in 0..4
               time = i * 1000 * 60
         
               # Create a new cell, called ``cell``
               cell = trial.make_new_cell()

   #. Set the onset of ``cell`` to the value of the ``time`` variable
      using :meth:`change_code()`, and ``end`` the ``for`` loop:

      .. code-block:: ruby
   
         require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
         begin
            trial = getVariable("trial")

            for i in 0..4
               time = i * 1000 * 60
               cell = trial.make_new_cell()
            
               # Set "onset" to the value of the ``time`` variable
               cell.change_code("onset", time)
            end

      T

#. Now that the loop is complete, write the changes back to the Datavyu
   spreadsheet and ``end`` the script:

   .. code-block:: ruby
   
      require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
      begin
         trial = getVariable("trial")

         for i in 0..4
            time = i * 1000 * 60
            cell = trial.make_new_cell()
            cell.change_code("onset", time)
         end
         
         # Write change back to the Datavyu spreadsheet
         setVariable(trial)
      end

.. end-content
