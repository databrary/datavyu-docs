==================================================
Use Two-Pass Verification to Improve Data Accuracy
==================================================

.. begin-content

With two-pass verification, two coders will separately code the same
data source. This enables you to check that the coders are observing
the same events, thereby improving data accuracy.

Make a Reliability Variable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To facilitate two-pass verification, you can create a :term:`reliability
variable`. In general, when creating reliability variables, you create
blank cells that correspond to the cells created in the first coding
pass. This ensures that the two coders will have observed the same
events in the data stream, and allows you to compare the two coding
passes.

The Datavyu Ruby API provides the :function:`makeReliability` function
for creating reliability variables. :function:`makeReliability` takes
at least 3 arguments:

.. include:: /api/reference/makeReliability.txt
   :start-after: table-start
   :end-before: table-end

.. tip:: 

   Specifying :term:`onset` in ``args_to_keep`` makes it easy for the
   reliability coder to navigate to the correct points in the data source
   and code the same events as the original coder.

The following example creates a new reliability variable called
"rel.trial" from the "trial" variable, skipping every other cell, and
copying over the "onset" and "trialnum" arguments so that the
reliability coder will not have to recode :term:`onset` and trial
numbers.

.. code-block:: ruby

   require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
   begin
      makeReliability("rel.trial", "trial", 2, "onset", "trialnum")
   end

.. note::

   You do **not** have to write the variable back to the database.
   :function:`makeReliability` automatically writes its results to 
   the database. This is the only function in the Datavyu Ruby API that
   automatically writes back to the database.

.. _api-check-reliability:

Check Reliability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have coded the reliability variable, you can use
:function:`checkReliability` to compare the primary and reliability
variables' cells. :function:`checkReliability` returns the number of
errors, and the percent agreement.

:function:`checkReliability()` has four required arguments, and one
optional one:

.. include:: /api/reference/checkReliability().txt
   :start-after: table-start
   :end-before: table-end

.. note:: 

   ``match_arg`` is particularly important: for
   :function:`checkReliability` to know which cells to compare, it needs
   to have some parameter that is unique to each pair of corresponding
   primary and reliability cells. For example, a trial number coded
   into each cell would match corresponding cells, even if only
   a subset of cells were included in the reliability variable.

   In order to avoid errors,you should endeavor to import the argument
   you will use as ``match_arg`` when you initially create your
   reliability variable with :function:`makeReliability`. 

.. code-block:: ruby

    require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
    begin
        # We have two variables that we want to compare, trial and rel.trial. They match on an argument called trialnumber.
        # We want to dump the results to a file on the desktop.

        # As before, File.expand_path with unfold the ~ in the filename to be our users' home directory
        dump_file = File.expand_path("~/Desktop/relcheck.txt")
        checkReliability("trial", "rel.trial", "trialnum", dump_file)
    end
