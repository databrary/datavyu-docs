Add Cells to a Variable
=======================

.. begin-content

Now that Lets do something a little more interesting than just adding an
argument. Lets add some cells to a column. 

Suppose that you are setting up a spreadsheet, and you know that there
are five trials in your data source, that occur at minute 0, minute 1,
minute 2, minute 3, and minute 4. In order to make it easier for the
coder to code the trials, you can programmatically create a blank cell
for each trial, with the onset set to its start time.

#. Set up our script, and load the Datavyu variable you will be working
   with:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
      begin
         # Load the Datavyu variable "trial" into Ruby variable called trial.
         trial = getVariable("trial")

#. Create the five cells using a loop. Loops are fancy bits of code
   that tells Ruby to do stuff multiple times.
   
   Let's break down the ``for`` loop from the following example for those
   who are less experienced programmers:
   
   .. code-block:: ruby

      for i in 0..4
         <do stuff>
      end
   
   This, essentially, says, "for i = 0, <do stuff>, Then, for i = 1, <do
   stuff>. Then for i = 2, for i = 3, and for i = 4. Once you've done i
   = 4, stop doing stuff." The ``0..4`` is a representation of "from 0
   to 4, inclusive". If you wanted to do something ten times, you could
   do ``for i in 0..9`` or ``for i in 1..10``. In our case, we're going
   to use ``i`` to set the :term:`onset` time of the cell, so having
   it start from 0 and go to 4 makes sense.
   
   #. So, we need to loop 5 times from 0 to 4, and then we need to
      calculate the onset time that we're going to set. Since Datavyu
      API uses times in milliseconds, we need to convert i (our minute
      marker) to milliseconds

      .. code-block:: ruby

         for i in 0..4
            # Calculate the onset time that we want to set
            # Remember that all times in Datavyu are milliseconds
            time = i * 1000 * 60

   #. Then, create the new cell using :function:`make_new_cell()`.
      We'll call it: ``cell``:
   
      .. code-block:: ruby

         cell = trial.make_new_cell()

   #. As the final step in our loop, we'll the onset of ``cell`` to our ``time`` variable, using
      :function:`change_arg()`, and ``end`` the loop:

      .. code-block:: ruby

         cell.change_arg("onset", time)
         end

   #. Finally, we'll write our changes back to the database and end the
      script:
   
      .. code-block:: ruby
      
         setVariable(trial)
         end

Let's look at it all put together:

.. code-block:: ruby

   require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
   begin
      trial = getVariable("trial")
      
      for i in 0..4
         time = i * 1000 * 60
         cell = trial.make_new_cell()
         cell.change_arg("onset", time)
      end
   
      setVariable(trial)
   end
