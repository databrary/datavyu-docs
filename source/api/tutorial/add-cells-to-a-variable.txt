Add Cells to a Variable
=======================

.. begin-content

Pre-populating a Datavyu variable with cells is another common task that
you can use scripts to automate. Suppose that you are setting up a
spreadsheet, and you know that there are five trials in your data
source, that occur at minute 0, minute 1, minute 2, minute 3, and minute
4. In order to make it easier for the coder to code the trials, you can
create a blank cell for each trial, with the :term:`onset` set to the
correct trial start time.

#. Set up the script, and load the Datavyu variable you will be working
   with into a Ruby variable called ``trial``:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
      begin
         # Load the Datavyu variable
         trial = getVariable("trial")

#. Create the five cells using a loop. 
   
   .. admonition:: Programming 101
   
      **Loops** are types of code that tell Ruby to do something multiple
      times. Let's break down the ``for`` loop from the following
      example for those who aren't familiar with loops:
   
      .. code-block:: ruby

         for i in 0..4
            <do stuff>
         end
   
      Essentially, this says, "for ``i`` = 0, <do stuff>, Then, for ``i`` = 1, <do
      stuff>. Then for ``i`` = 2, for ``i`` = 3, and for ``i`` = 4. Once you've done i
      = 4, stop doing stuff." The ``0..4`` represents "from 0
      to 4, inclusive". 
      
      If you wanted to do something ten times, your loop might read
      ``for i in 0..9`` or ``for i in 1..10``, or ``for i in 99..108``.
      In our case, we're going to use ``i`` to set the :term:`onset`
      time of the cell, so having it start at 0 and go to 4 makes
      sense.
   
   We need to loop 5 times from 0 to 4, calculating the onset time to
   set for each new cell. Since Datavyu API uses times in milliseconds,
   we need to convert i (our minute marker) to milliseconds

   .. code-block:: ruby
   
      require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
      begin
         trial = getVariable("trial")

         for i in 0..4
            # Calculate the onset time that we want to set in milliseconds
            time = i * 1000 * 60

#. Then, create the new cell using :function:`make_new_cell()`.
   We'll store the cell as a Ruby variable called ``cell``:

   .. code-block:: ruby
   
      require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
      begin
         trial = getVariable("trial")

         for i in 0..4
            time = i * 1000 * 60
         
            # Create a new cell, called ``cell``
            cell = trial.make_new_cell()

#. Set the onset of ``cell`` to the value of the ``time``
   variable, using :function:`change_arg()`, and ``end`` the ``for`` loop:

   .. code-block:: ruby
   
      require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
      begin
         trial = getVariable("trial")

         for i in 0..4
            time = i * 1000 * 60
            cell = trial.make_new_cell()
            
            # Set "onset" to the value of the ``time`` variable
            cell.change_arg("onset", time)
         end

#. Finally, write the changes back to the Datavyu database and ``end``
   the script:

   .. code-block:: ruby
   
      require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
      begin
         trial = getVariable("trial")

         for i in 0..4
            time = i * 1000 * 60
            cell = trial.make_new_cell()
            cell.change_arg("onset", time)
         end
         
         # Write change back to the Datavyu database
         setVariable(trial)
      end

.. Let's look at it all put together:

.. .. code-block:: ruby

..    require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
      begin
         trial = getVariable("trial")
         for i in 0..4
            time = i * 1000 * 60
            cell = trial.make_new_cell()
            cell.change_arg("onset", time)
         end
         setVariable(trial)
      end
