Manual Export Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Datavyu supports numerous data export methods. We will cover four common
approaches here:

#. A straight dump to CSV file where cells correspond to what was coded
   in Datavyu.

#. A straight *frame-by-frame* dump detailing all observations 
   associated with each frame.

#. A *nested* dump, which loops through each column and nests cells
   appropriately, 

#. A *nested* dump *with un-nested cells*, which is similar to a the
   nested dump, but which also works if your cells do not nest.

These methods will be covered in the order they are listed above, which
also happens to be in order of increasing complexity.

Method 1: Direct Dump to CSV

This method is actually much easier to do (only 1 line!) with the new R
scripting functions. Please see the R guide for instructions. However,
we will still cover how to do this in Ruby here.

Method 2: Frame by Frame Dump
`````````````````````````````

We can also dump a file frame by frame if we know the framerate of the
video that was coded. The idea here is to generate a new row in a
spreadsheet for each frame of the video, with the value of each argument
in each cell in its own column. For long videos, this type of exporting
may take too long (a 2 hour video at 30fps is 216,000 rows!), but for
short videos this is an easy and intuitive export method.

To do this, we loop over all of the columns in the spreadsheet and grab
the current cell at each time, moving one frame at a time (so there will
be an entry for 00:00:033, 00:00:066, and so on, all the way until the
end of a video for a 30fps video).
