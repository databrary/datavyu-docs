Manual Export Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Datavyu supports numerous data export methods. This section covers four
common approaches, in order of increasing complexity:

- A straight dump to CSV file where cells correspond to the coded cells
  in Datavyu.

- A straight *frame-by-frame* dump detailing all observations 
  associated with each frame.

- A *nested* dump, which loops through each column and nests cells
  appropriately, 

- A *nested dump with un-nested cells*, which is similar to the
  nested dump, but which also works if your cells do not nest.

Method 1: Direct Dump to CSV
````````````````````````````

This method is actually much easier to do (only 1 line!) with Datavyu's
R scripting functions. 

To create a direct dump to CSV using R, 

.. code-block:: rout

   [codes here]

The following steps will create the same outcome using Ruby:

Method 2: Frame by Frame Dump
`````````````````````````````

We can also dump a file frame by frame if we know the :term:`frame rate`
of the coded video. This creates a new spreadsheet row for each frame of
the data source, with the value of each code in its own column. For long
videos, this type of export may be too lengthy to be feasible: a 2 hour
video at 30fps is 216,000 rows. However, for short videos this is an
easy and intuitive export method.

To do this, we loop over all of the columns in the spreadsheet and grab
the current cell at each time, moving one frame at a time (so there will
be an entry for 00:00:033, 00:00:066, and so on, all the way until the
end of a video for a 30fps video).

Method 3: Nested dump
`````````````````````

   :align: right

A *nested dump* exports data based on the nesting of :term:`cells
<cell>`. This is most useful for spreadsheets whose cells group together.
For instance, the following spreadsheet example has three columns:
"id", "trial", and "foot". "id" is a participant ID, which might include
codes that describe the participant's individual id code, their gender,
age, etc. "trial" is a column that delineates each trial the participant
participated in, and "foot" is a column representing observations
recorded during each trial.

The cells, then, group together with an "id" cell covering the length of
all trials. There are two trials in the example, and there are several
"foot" cells that align within the time limits of each trial.

To export data from this style of spreadsheet, we will use a series of
:ref:`loops`, exporting a row of tab-separated values for each cell in
the foot column. Each row will include the "id" and "trial" data that
the foot cell nests beside. This spreadsheet follows [reference to best
practices guide that talks about one file / participant], so there is
only one "id" cell, since all of the data in that spreadsheet is for a
single participant.

#. Set up the script, and then define where you are going to output the
   file to. You need to define the location of the file (in this case,
   the Desktop, defined by ``out_file``), and create a Ruby object to
   hold the new file's data as it outputs it, which we'll call ``out``:
   
   .. code-block:: ruby
   
      require 'Datavyu_API.rb'

      begin
      
         # Defines the location of the file that we're going to be outputting 
      	# the spreadsheet data to - the file name is DataOutput.txt
      	# and is located on the Desktop.
         out_file = File.expand_path("~/Desktop/DataOutput.txt")
         
         # Creates the file, and assigns write permissions so that the system
         # can write to it ('w')
         out = File.new(out_file,'w')

#. Retrieve the columns you want to output from the spreadsheet, and
   assign them to :class:`RColumn` objects:
   
   .. code-block:: ruby
   
      require 'Datavyu_API.rb'

      begin
      
         out_file = File.expand_path("~/Desktop/DataOutput.txt")
         out = File.new(out_file,'w')
         
         # Retrieve the "id", "trial" and "foot" columns from the spreadsheet   
         # and assign them to RColumn objects
         
         id = getColumn("id")
         trial = getColumn("trial")
         foot = getColumn("foot")

#. Set up a series of ``for`` loops that we will use to iterate over
   each cell in the columns we're interested in.

   
   .. code-block:: ruby
   
      require 'Datavyu_API.rb'

      begin
      
         out_file = File.expand_path("~/Desktop/DataOutput.txt")
         out = File.new(out_file,'w')
         
         id = getColumn("id")
         trial = getColumn("trial")
         foot = getColumn("foot")
         
         # Set up a series of nested for loops, following the nesting
         # of the cells: "id", then "trial", then "foot".
         # 
         # This will iterate through every "cell"
         # in id, every cell in "trial", and every cell in "foot".
         # 
         # idcell, tcell, and fcell are temporary Ruby variables
         # that hold the data for a cell as the cell is iterated over.
         
         
         for idcell in id.cells
            for tcell in trial.cells
               for fcell in foot.cells

#. Write an ``if`` clause that checks if cells are nested. In plain
   English, this ``if`` statement checks if the :term:`onset` of the 
   ``foot`` cell (``fcell``) occurs after the onset of the ``trial`` 
   cell (``tcell``) and that the :term:`offset` of the ``fcell`` occurs
   *before* the offset of the ``tcell``. Or, in even plainer English,
   that the ``fcell`` occurs during the length of the ``tcell``.
   
   If the clauses are met, write the cells' codes to the ``out`` file, 
   separated by tabs.
   
   .. code-block:: ruby
   
      require 'Datavyu_API.rb'

      begin
      
         out_file = File.expand_path("~/Desktop/DataOutput.txt")
         out = File.new(out_file,'w')
         
         id = getColumn("id")
         trial = getColumn("trial")
         foot = getColumn("foot")
            
         for idcell in id.cells
            for tcell in trial.cells
               for fcell in foot.cells

                  # Set up if statement that checks for cell encapsulation
                  
                  if lcell.onset >= tcell.onset && lcell.offset <= tcell.offset

#. If the ``if`` clause is met, write the cells' codes to the ``out`` file,
   separated by tabs. 
   
   As a refresher, cells have a series of codes: onset, offset, and
   ordinal by default, as well as any user-specified codes. To access
   the codes in one of our temporary Ruby variables (``icell``, ``tcell``, and ``fcell``),
   we use the format ``cellName.codeName``. To access the "idnum" code
   in the "id" column, then, we'd request ``icell.idnum``.
      
   Since the script is outputting :term:`strings <string>`, we also need
   to convert the onset, offset, and ordinals from the :term:`integer`
   format to the string format, using ``to_s``.

   .. code-block:: ruby
   
      require 'Datavyu_API.rb'

      begin
      
         out_file = File.expand_path("~/Desktop/DataOutput.txt")
         out = File.new(out_file,'w')
         
         id = getColumn("id")
         trial = getColumn("trial")
         foot = getColumn("foot")
            
         for idcell in id.cells
            for tcell in trial.cells
               for fcell in foot.cells                  
                  if fcell.onset >= tcell.onset && fcell.offset <= tcell.offset

                     # Write the cells' codes to the output file, separated by tabs - the "\t"
                     # You must include a newline indicated, "\n" so that the next cells' codes
                     # will be output on a new line, giving them their own row.
                     out.write(idcell.idnum + "\t" + tcell.onset.to_s + "\t" + tcell.offset.to_s + "\t" + tcell.trial + "\t" + fcell.ordinal.to_s + "\t" + fcell.onset.to_s + "\t" + fcell.offset.to_s + "\t" + fcell.side + "\n")

                     # End the if clause, and the for loops, as well as the script
                  end
               end
            end
         end
      
      end
