Write Ruby Scripts for Datavyu
==============================

This detailed guide describes to write Ruby scripts to automate various
tasks in Datavyu, and to ensure reliable :term:`coding <code>`,

For a more in-depth discussion of each particular method and function,
please see :doc:`the Davayu Ruby API Reference section </api/reference>`.

Recommended Text Editors
------------------------

Ruby scripts are simply text files with a ``.rb`` file extension. You
can write scripts in any text editor, such as Notepad or TextEdit.
However, while those editors are adequate for scripting purposes, modern
text editors make scripts much easier to read by providing syntax
highlighting, which can make a world of difference when attempting to
debug an issue.

   "Mac Classic" theme. Note that the same "add-cells-to-variable.rb" is
   open in each editor.

We recommend installing and using one of the following
programs for editing Ruby scripts:

- Windows:

  - `Notepad++ <http://notepad-plus-plus.org/>`__ (free and open-source)
  - `Notepad2 <http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html>`__ (free and open-source)

- Mac OSX:

  - `TextMate 2 <https://api.textmate.org/downloads/beta>`__ (free and open-source)
  - `gedit <http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/>`__ (free and open-source)
  - `TextWrangler <http://www.barebones.com/products/TextWrangler/>`__ (free)

- Linux:

  - `gedit <http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/>`__ (free and open-source)
  - `kate <http://kate-editor.org/>`__ (free and open-source)

.. tip:: 
   
   Syntax highlighting generally depends on file extensions. The file
   extension tells the text editor what kind of file it is. If the Ruby
   script file does not have the ``.rb`` extension, you might not get
   proper syntax highlighting, so ensure that your Ruby script files end
   in ``.rb``.

General Principles
------------------

- Each cell has three required fields: ``onset``, ``offset``, and
  ``ordinal``. Each cell also takes at least one :term:`argument`,
  [what's an argument?].

- ``onset``, ``offset``, and ``ordinal`` are all :term:`integers <integer>` rather tha
  n :term:`strings <string>`.

- ``onset`` and ``offset`` are measured in **milliseconds from the
  beginning of the video (or other data stream)**, starting from 0. For
  instance, an ``onset`` time of 00:02:20 translates to 140000ms.

- Cell arguments are :term:`strings <string>`. As such, if you wish to do math
  with a coded argument, you must first convert it to an integer. Since
  ``onset``, ``offset``, and ``ordinal`` are already integers, you don't
  need to retype them.
  
  The following example creates an integer variable from a string
  variable:

  Create a variable, ``var1`` whose value is a number ``5`` stored as a string

  .. code-block:: ruby

     var1 = "5"
     
  Convert it to an integer using ``to_i`` and save it to a new variable

  .. code-block:: ruby

     var2 = var1.to_i
     
  Print some math result

  .. code-block:: ruby

     puts var2 * 2

- To print something to the console, you have two options: the ``p``
  command and the ``puts`` command. When in doubt, use ``p``, as it
  prints arrays and lists in a more readable format, rather than mashing
  them all together like ``puts`` does. Run the following example for
  yourself to see the difference:
   
  .. code-block:: ruby

     # Print 5 using p
     p 5

     # Also prints 5 using puts
     puts 5

     # Now to show the difference, print a list
     p [5,6,7,8,9] 
     puts [5,6,7,8,9]


Basic Script Format
-------------------

In order to work, all scripts must include the following line at the top:

.. code-block:: ruby

   require 'Datavyu_API.rb'

This ``require`` statement loads all of the helper functions that help
Ruby talk to the Datavyu database.

In general, the rest of the script code goes between ``begin`` and
``end`` tags like so:

.. code-block:: ruby

   require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
   begin
     # Get the variables that we want to work with

     # Do something to those variables

     # Write any changes to those variables back to the database
   end

.. tip::

   Anything that comes after a ``#`` character on a line in Ruby is a
   "comment", which means it will not execute. Comments are useful for
   explaining what the code is doing so that you remember when you look
   at the script 6 months from now. The examples in this documentation
   use comments extensively.

Now that you've got a good grounding in the Datavyu Ruby API, consider
the :doc:`/api/script-examples` or :doc:`/api/reference`.
