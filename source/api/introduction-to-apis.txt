Introduction to APIs
====================

APIs, Application Program Interfaces, are collections of code that
specify how software components communicate with each other. APIs are
incredibly prevalent tools: when you log into a website using your
Facebook or Google credentials, for instance, a web API helps that
website communicate with Facebook or Google's software. Similarly, when
you use a piece of Windows software, its programmers likely used the
Windows API to communicate with Windows itself, accessing drivers,
printers, and even the user interface.

The Datavyu API works somewhat differently: instead of helping two
applications communicate, it helps users to perform tasks
programmatically, altering their Datavyu spreadsheets and databases
using :term:`scripts <script>`.

Suppose you had an hour-long video data source. Perhaps it showed
[representative example], with each trial lasting one minute. The first
trial, then, would start at 00:00:00, the second at 00:01:00, and so on,
up to the 60th trial at 00:59:00. You might want to create a "trial"
column, where you would code each trial's metadata, with its
:term:`onset` at the minute mark, and its offset just prior. Manually
creating sixty cells (largely blank) cells would be time-consuming,
and not a particularly good use of a researcher's time. 

Computers are ideally suited for doing repetitive tasks quickly. The
Datavyu API can enable a researcher to perform these kinds of tasks
programmatically, so that creating sixty cells and setting their
onsets becomes a matter of writing a few lines of code and running the
script.

The Datavyu API provides ways to check a coder's work, create columns,
export data, and update columns, cells, and [codes], to name a few.
Writing scripts with the API is straightforward and accessible to even
a novice programmer. The abilityt o use scripts to automate tasks greatly
increases the ways that Datavyu can facilitate data collection and
analysis, and is well worth traversing the initial learning curve.

Ruby and You
------------

Ruby is a programming language that has become particularly popular over
the last decade. Designed to be easy to work with, Ruby [words]. For a
good introduction to Ruby, consider going through the 
`Ruby in Twenty Minutes <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/>`_
tutorial, which provides a quick overview to working in Ruby.

You do not need to be an experienced programmer – or even to really
understand the ins and outs of Ruby – to be able to write scripts with
the Datavyu API. Following the :doc:`API tutorials </api/tutorials>` is
a good way to become familiar with scripting for Datavyu. With some
practice, and you will likely be able to customize the sample scripts
for your own purposes. However, gaining a grounding in some programming
concepts will make it easier to create your own scripts for your unique
use cases and needs.

The following documents describe the Datavyu API mechanics in more
detail, and provide a high-level overview of the API components that you
will be working with:
