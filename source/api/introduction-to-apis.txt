Introduction to APIs
====================

.. default-domain:: rb

APIs, Application Program Interfaces, are collections of code that
allow software components to communicate with each other. 

The Datavyu API lets users write :term:`scripts <script>` in a Ruby programming
interface that can modify the contents of Datavyu spreadsheets.

Suppose you have a data set that contains fifty Datavyu files and videos. 
After you analyze your data, you realize that you want to go back and code 
a new pass for all of your files. Instead of manually creating a new column 
in all fifty Datavyu files, you can write a script that will do it for you! 
The script can include any and all desired codes within the column, save time, 
and reduce the potential risk of error. 

Or suppose you want to change the name of a code. You can use a script to make 
the changes across all the relevant files. 

Or perhaps you’d like a reliability coder to score 25% of each participant’s video. 
You can use a script to create a “reliability column” and insert every fourth cell 
(or a randomly selected 25% or any other metric) into that column.

Or maybe you want to check each file for typos or impossible onset/offset times. 
Use a script for data checking!

Computers are ideally suited for doing repetitive tasks quickly and conistently. The
Datavyu API enables a researcher to perform these kinds of tasks
programmatically, so that doing a repetitive task becomes a matter 
of writing a few lines of computer code and running the script.

Writing scripts with the API is straightforward and accessible to even
a novice programmer. The ability to use scripts to automate tasks greatly
increases the ways that Datavyu can facilitate data coding and
analysis, and is well worth overcoming the initial learning curve.

Ruby and You
------------

For a
good introduction to Ruby, consider going through the 
`Ruby in Twenty Minutes <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/>`_
tutorial, which provides a quick overview to working in Ruby.

You do not need to be an experienced programmer or even 
understand the ins and outs of Ruby to be able to write scripts with
the Datavyu API. Following the :doc:`API tutorials </api/tutorials>`
is a good way to become familiar with scripting for Datavyu. With some
practice, and you will likely be able to customize the sample scripts
for your own purposes. However, gaining a grounding in some
programming concepts will make it easier to create your own scripts
for your unique use cases and needs.

Consider :doc:`/api/overview` for an introduction to object oriented
programming, :term:`classes <class>`, and :term:`methods <method>`.
Also, :doc:`/api/introduction-to-scripting` discusses the
requirements you should keep in mind when you start writing scripts.
