Classes, Methods, and Parameters

Ruby, the programming language that the Datavyu API uses, is an object-
oriented language. 

Classes
-------

Object-oriented languages represent concepts, like
Datavyu's columns or cells, for instance, as "objects". Types of
objects are called :term:`"classes" <class>`>. 

Objects have attributes: data that pertains to the
object. In Datavyu, a cell object's attributes would be its codes; a column
object's attributes might be its cells, its name, etc. Objects are
generally "instances of classes".  To put it differently, classes are
types of objects, and the objects that you work with directly in your
code are one occurrence of its class's type.

Thinking about Datavyu specifically, then, you would likely have a
"column" class that describes the Datavyu columns.  The "trial" column
would then be an instance of the "column" class. This is, in fact, how the
Datavyu API works: the Datavyu API includes two classes to represent
datavyu concepts: :class:`RColumn` describes Datavyu's
:term:`columns <column>`, and :class:`RCell` describes Datavyu's
:term:`cells <cell>`.

Methods and Their Parameters
----------------------------

While classes describe objects, :term:`methods <method>` define actions
that you can perform. The Datavyu API defines numerous methods to help
you manipulate, modify, add, and delete data in the Datavyu
spreadsheets.

In order to work, many methods need additional information: for
instance, :meth:`getColumn()`, which retrieves a column from a Datavyu
spreadsheet so that you can modify or update it using your script,
needs you to tell it what column it should retreive.
Each method defines what information it can receive: these are called
:term:`parameters <parameter>`. :meth:`getColumn()` has one parameter: ``name``,
which is the name of the column that you wish to retreive.

So, parameters are the types of information that you can specify to a
method, and are specified in the method's definition (you can view all
of Datavyu's methods' definitions on the :doc:`api reference page
</api/reference>`). 

The information you actually provide when you use the method is called an
"argument". Arguments are user-specified: for :meth:`getColumn()`, you
might want to retreive a column called "trial", so "trial" would be your
argument for the ``name`` parameter. Again, parameters are part of the
method's definition, while arguments are the information you provide
to the method.

For example, the :meth:`add_codes_to_column` method enables users to
programmatically add one or more codes to a
column. :meth:`add_codes_to_column` has two parameters: ``column``,
the name of the column you want to update, and ``*codes``. The ``*``
indicates that the parameter is a list: so you can specify one (or
more) codes as a list of :term:`Strings <string>`.

Suppose you wanted to add two codes, "leftHand" and "rightHand" to the
"arm" column. "arm" would be your argument for the ``column``
parameter, and ``"leftHand", "rightHand"`` your argument for the
``*codes`` parameter. ``column`` and ``code`` are specified in the
:meth:`add_codes_to_column` method definition, and "arm", "leftHand",
and "rightHand" are your user-specified arguments.

Standalone Methods and Class Methods
------------------------------------

There are two different types of methods: standalone methods, and
:term:`class methods <class method>`>. Class methods act directly upon
an instance of a specific class. Standalone methods,
perform actions on their own.

:meth:`getColumn()` is a standalone method that you use to retrieve
a column from the Datavyu spreadsheet so that you can modify it with your
script. To retrieve a column called "trial" from the spreadsheet, you
would run:

.. code-block:: ruby

   getColumn("trial")

In contrast, :meth:`add_code` is a class method of the
:class:`RColumn` class, and *is invoked* on an
:class:`RColumn` instance. Assuming that you have already retrieved a
column called "trial" from the spreadsheet, and assigned it to an
:class:`RColumn` instance, the following code would add the *newCode*
code to the "trial" :class:`RColumn` object:

.. code-block:: ruby

   trial.add_code("newCode")

Comparing them side-by-side can help highlight the difference:

Understanding the difference between standalone and class methods
will make it easier for you to easily use the methods included in the
Datavyu API.

Now that you have a sound grounding in the difference betwene classes
and methods, understand parameters are arguments, and know how to
invoke both standalone and class methods, consider our
