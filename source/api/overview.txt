Classes, Methods, and Parameters
================================

.. default-domain:: rb

Ruby, the programming language that the Datavyu API uses, is an object-
oriented language. 

Classes
-------

Object-oriented languages represent concepts, like
Datavyu's columns or cells, for instance, as "objects". Types of
objects are called "classes". 

Objects have attributes: data that pertains to the
object. In Datavyu, a cell object's attributes would be its codes; a column
object's attributes might be its cells, its name, etc. Objects are
generally "instances of classes".  To put it differently, classes are
types of objects, and the objects that you work with directly in your
code are one occurrence of its class's type.

Thinking about Datavyu specifically, then, you would likely have a
"column" class that describes the Datavyu columns.  The "trial" column
would then be an instance of the "column" class. This is, in fact, how the
Datavyu API works: the Datavyu API includes two classes to represent
datavyu concepts: :class:`RVariable` describes Datavyu's
:term:`columns <column>`, and :class:`RCell` describes Datavyu's
:term:`cells <cell>`.

Methods and their Parameters
----------------------------

While classes describe objects, :term:`methods <method>` define actions
that you can perform. The Datavyu API defines numerous methods to help
you manipulate, modify, add, and delete data in the Datavyu
spreadsheets.

In order to work, many methods need additional information: for
instance, :meth:`getColumn`, which retrieves a column from a Datavyu
spreadsheet so that you can modify or update it using your script,
needs you to tell it what column it should retreive.
Each method defines what information it can receive: these are called
:term:`parameters`. :meth:`getColumn` has one parameter: ``name``,
which is the name of the column that you wish to retreive.

So, parameters are the types of information that you can specify to a
method, and are specified in the method's definition (you can view all
of Datavyu's methods' definitions on the :doc:`api reference page
</api/reference>`). 

The information you actually provide when you use the method is called an
"argument". Arguments are user-specified: for :meth:`getVariable`, you
might want to retreive a column called "trial", so "trial" is your
argument for the ``name`` parameter. Again, parameters are part of the
method's definition, while arguments are the information you provide
to the method.

.. admonition:: Example

   :meth:`checkReliability` is an important method for Datavyu: it
   enables you to compare two coding passes of the same data, to see
   if the coders are recording consistent
   information. :meth:`checkReliability` has five parameters: four are
   required (``main_col``, ``rel_col``, ``match_arg``, and
   ``time-tolerance``), and one is optional (``dump_file``).

Standalone Methods and Class Methods
--------------------------------------

 Some methods belong to classes: these :term:`"class
methods" <class method>` act directly upon an instance of a specific
class. Other methods, "standalone methods", perform actions on their
own.

:meth:`getColumn()` is a standalone method that you use to retrieve
a column from the Datavyu spreadsheet so that you can modify it with your
script. To retrieve a column called "trial" from the spreadsheet, you
would run:

.. code-block:: ruby

   getColumn("trial")

In contrast, :meth:`add_code` is a class method of the
:class:`RVariable` class, and *is invoked* on an
:class:`RVariable` instance. Assuming that you have already retrieved a
column called "trial" from the spreadsheet, and assigned it to an
:class:`RVariable` instance, the following code would add the *newCode*
code to the "trial" :class:`RVariable` object:

.. code-block:: ruby

   trial.add_code("newCode")

Comparing them side-by-side can help highlight the difference:

Understanding the difference between standalone and class methods
will make it easier for you to easily use the methods included in the
Datavyu API.

classes and methods, and know how to invoke both standalone
and class methods, consider our :doc:`/api/introduction-to-scripting`
