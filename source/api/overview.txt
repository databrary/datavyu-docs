Ruby, the programming language that the Datavyu API uses, is an object-
oriented language. 

Classes
-------

Object-oriented languages represent concepts, like
Datavyu's columns or cells, for instance, as "objects". Types of
objects are called "classes". 

Objects have attributes: data that pertains to the
object. In Datavyu, a cell object's attributes would be its [codes]; a column
object's attributes might be its cells, its name, etc. Objects are
generally "instances of classes".  To put it differently, classes are
types of objects, and the objects that you work with directly in your
code are one occurrence of its class's type.

Thinking about Datavyu specifically, then, you would likely have a
column class that describes the Datavyu columns.  The "trial" column
would then be an instance of the "column" class. This is, in fact, how the
Datavyu API works: the Datavyu API includes two classes to represent
datavyu concepts: :class:`RVariable` describes Datavyu's
:term:`columns <column>`, and :class:`RCell` describes Datavyu's
:term:`cells <cell>`.

Standalone Methods and Class Methods
--------------------------------------

While classes describe objects, :term:`methods <method>` define actions
that you can perform. Some methods belong to classes: these :term:`"class
methods" <class method>` act directly upon an instance of a specific
class. Other methods, "standalone methods", perform actions on their
own.

:meth:`getColumn()` is a standalone method that you use to retrieve
a column from the Datavyu database so that you can modify it with your
script. To retrieve a column called "trial" from the database, you
would run:

.. code-block:: ruby

   getColumn("trial")

In contrast, :meth:`add_code` is a class method of the
:class:`RVariable` class, and *is invoked* on an
:class:`RVariable` instance. Assuming that you have already retrieved a
column called "trial" from the database, and assigned it to an
:class:`RVariable` instance, the following code would add the *newCode*
code to the "trial" :class:`RVariable` object:

.. code-block:: ruby

   trial.add_code("newCode")

Comparing them side-by-side can help highlight the difference:

Understanding the difference between standalone and class methods
will make it easier for you to easily use the methods included in the
Datavyu API.

Now that you have a sound grounding in the difference betwene
classes and methods, and know how to invoke both standalone
and class methods, consider our :doc:`/api/introduction-to-scripting`
