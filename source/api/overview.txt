Datavyu Ruby API Classes & Methods Overview
===========================================

.. default-domain:: rb

The Datavyu API's :term:`methods <method>` of the fall into three
general categories: methods that modify :term:`columns`, methods that
modify :term:`cells`, and methods used for verification or to provide
consistency.

Classes
-------


Methods
-------

Columns
~~~~~~~

:term:`Columns` are the highest level grouping in Datavyu, and the
majority of scripts will involve retrieving columns from the Datavyu
database (using :meth:`getVariable`) and then updating columns
using :meth:`setVariable`. 

You can also create a brand new column using :meth:`createVariable`.

Primarily used as a step in a larger task, :meth:`make_new_cell`
creates a new blank cell at the end of the current column's cell array.
Unlike :meth:`getVariable` or :meth:`setVariable`, which are
:term:`standalone methods`, :meth:`make_new_cell` is a method of the
:class:`RVariable` class, and as such must be invoked on a
:class:`RVariable` variable.

The :meth:`add_arg` method enables users to add a [code] to a
variable. Like :meth:`make_new_cell` :meth:`add_arg` and
must be invoked on a :class:`RVariable` variable.

Cells
~~~~~

:meth:`change_arg` operates directly at the cell level, and enables
you to change the value of a cell's [code]. :meth:`change_arg` is a
method of the :class:`RCell` class and must be invoked on a
:class:`RClass` variable.

Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verification methods are a special category. These methods may touch
more than one Datavyu component as they perform tasks that support
verifying coders' work or facilitating two~pass verification.

:meth:`checkValidCodes` tests each coded value within a column
against a list of valid possibilities. You could use this to check
for typographic errors, such as a 'j' when only a 'k' is a valid entry.

Similarly, :meth:`makeReliability` and :meth:`checkReliability`
support using two~pass verification to ensure that coders are recording
accurate observations. :meth:`makeReliability` creates a new column
from an existing coded column so that a second coder can code the same
data source. Using :meth:`checkReliability`, you can then compare the
original and "reliability" columns to see that the two coders recorded
the same phenomena.
