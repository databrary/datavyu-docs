Much like :doc:`/api/tutorials/add-cells-to-a-column` or :doc:`/api/tutorials/add-codes-to-a-column`, 
the Datavyu API allows you to create a completely
new column using the :meth:`createColumn()` method.
:meth:`createColumn()` takes at least two parameters: first, the name of the new column,
followed by a list of the names of the new codes contained in the column.

For example, suppose you wanted to add a column called "look" to your
spreadsheet. And you wanted "look" to contain two codes: *direction* and
*target*.

#. Set up the script, and create a new column with its two codes.
   You will need to create a Ruby object to hold the
   data until you are ready to write it back to the spreadsheet. In
   this example, the Ruby object is called ``look``:

   .. code-block:: ruby
   
      require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
      begin
         # Create new column
         look = createColumn("look", "direction", "target")

#. Write the new column back to the spreadsheet and ``end`` the script:
   
   .. code-block:: ruby
   
      require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
      begin
         look = createColumn("look", "direction", "target")

         # Write the new column to Datavyu's spreadsheet.
         setColumn(look)
      end

.. end-content
