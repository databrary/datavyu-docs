=======================
Check for Coding Errors
=======================

.. default-domain:: rb

.. begin-content

One of the most powerful uses for Datavyu scripts is checking for coding
errors. Since Datavyu does not enforce any rules during coding, it is
possible for coders to input an invalid code. A good example is
inputting an "h", when only "j" or "k" are acceptable values. Using
scripts, coders can double-check their work for errors and note them
early on.

Datavyu API provides the :meth:`checkValidCodes` method to check for
coder errors. :meth:`checkValidCodes` requires at least three
arguments: the name of the column it will verify, the location that it
will output the results to, and at least one :term:`key-value pair`.
Key-value pairs consist of a "key", the name of a Datavyu code, and a
"value", which is an array of valid values for that code.
:meth:`checkValidCodes` then checks each code (key) against its list
of valid values (the values).

The following examples check the ``step`` column against its codes. You
can download the sample data used in this tutorial from :download:`here
</resources/SampleData-checkValidCodes.opf>`.

Check Code Validity and Output to the Console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Basic Format

.. admonition:: Example

   .. code-block:: ruby

      require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
      begin
         # Check for errors. Notice the square brackets. These denote
         # lists. The basic format is: "columnName", "dumpFile",
         # "codename", ["validcode1", "validcode2", etc], 
         # "code2", [ "validcode1", "validcode2", etc], ...

         checkValidCodes("step", "", "foot", ["l", "r"], "ht", ["h", "t"], "direction", ["f","b"])
      end

   Breaking down the function call makes it easier to follow what is
   happening. Recall that :meth:`checkValidCodes` takes (at least) three
   arguments: the name of the Datavyu variable it will be checking, the
   location that it should direct the output to, and at least one key-value
   pair.

In the example, we have:

.. code-block:: ruby

   checkValidCodes("step", "", "foot", ["l", "r"], "ht", ["h", "t"], "direction", ["f","b"])

- ``"step"`` is the name of the variable to check, and 

- ``""`` is the location that we want to dump the output to. Using
  ``""`` indicates that we do not want to write the results to a file,
  and that it should instead display in the console.

- ``"foot", ["l", "r"]`` is the first key-value pair, which specifies
  that the "foot" Datavyu [code] should only have the values "l" or "r".
   
- ``"ht" , ["h", "t"]`` is the second key-value pair, which specifies
  that the "ht" Datavyu [code] should only have the values "h" or "t".

- ``"direction", ["f", "b"]`` is the third (and final) key-value pair,
  which specifies that the "direction" Datavyu [code] should only have
  the values "f" or "b".

You can perform the same verification by first assigning the valid codes
to objects. This makes it is easier for human readers to parse the
script, and makes it easy to modify or update the valid code lists
in the future.

#. Set up the script

   .. code-block:: ruby

      require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
      begin

#. Assign each list of valid codes to a variable:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
      begin
         # Store each of the valid code arrays into a object first
         # so that it is easier to read
         footCodes = ["l", "r"]
         htCodes = ["h", "t"]
         directionCodes = ["f", "b"]

#. Check for coding errors using :meth:`checkValidCodes`, replacing
   the lists with your newly-created objects, and end the script:
   
   .. code-block:: ruby

      require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
      begin
         footCodes = ["l", "r"]
         htCodes = ["h", "t"]
         directionCodes = ["f", "b"]

         # Check for typos, replacing the code arrays with your new variables:
         checkValidCodes("step", "", "foot", footCodes, "ht", htCodes, "direction", directionCodes)
      end

Check Code Validity and Output to a File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:meth:`checkValidCodes` can write the results of its verification to a
"dump file". Datavyu will create an output file if you specify a path
in the ``dumpFile`` parameter.

#. Create an object that holds the path that it should output to using
   Ruby's `File.expand_path 
   <http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/File.html#method-c-expand_path>`_ 
   method, which converts a relative path,
   like ``~/Desktop/file.txt`` to an absolute path name, which contains
   the root directory, and all sub-directories, like
   ``/Users/alice/Desktop/file.txt``

   The following commands create a variable called ``output`` that
   holds the absolute path to a file on the Desktop called
   ``output.txt``.

   .. code-block:: ruby

      require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
      begin
      
         output = File.expand_path("~/Desktop/output.txt")

#. Call :meth:`checkValidCodes` on the "step" column, passing ``output``
   as the argument for the ``dumpFile`` parameter:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
      begin
         footCodes = ["l", "r"]
         htCodes = ["h", "t"]
         directionCodes = ["f", "b"]

         output = File.expand_path("~/Desktop/output.txt")

         # Check for errors, specifying the output variable as the dumpFile parameter 
         checkValidCodes("step", output, "foot", footCodes, "ht", htCodes, "direction", directionCodes)
      end

When the script ends, the output.txt file will be created on the
Desktop, containing the results of the code checking. For the
:download:`sample data </resources/SampleData-checkValidCodes.opf>`, 
it should find one error, and the output should resemble:

   .. code-block:: sh
   
      Code ERROR: Var: step   Ordinal: 2      Arg: foot     Val: rj

.. end-content
