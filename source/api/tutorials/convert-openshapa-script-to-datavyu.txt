=================================================
Convert an OpenSHAPA Script to the Datavyu Format
=================================================

.. default-domain:: rb

If you have previously written scripts for use with OpenSHAPA, you
can easily reuse them with Datavyu.

Datavyu's Ruby API was designed to be compatible with the earlier
scripting formats. To updatescripts from OpenSHAPA, you simply need to 
delete the OpenSHAPA API code at the beginning of the file and replace 
it with the following line of code:

.. code-block:: ruby

   require 'Datavyu_API.rb'

You will also need to delete the OpenSHAPA API code at the beginning
of the file.

And with that, you should be good to run your existing OpenSHAPA
scripts through Datavyu.
