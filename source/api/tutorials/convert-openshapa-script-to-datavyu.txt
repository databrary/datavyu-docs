=================================================
Convert an OpenSHAPA Script to the Datavyu Format
=================================================

.. default-domain:: rb

If you have previously written scripts for use with OpenSHAPA, you
can easily reuse them with Datavyu.

Datavyu's Ruby API was designed to interoperate with the earlier
formats, so you need simply add the following line of code to the
beginning of your script:

.. code-block:: ruby

   require 'Datavyu_API.rb'

You will also need to delete the OpenSHAPA API code at the beginning
of the file.

And with that, you should be good to run your existing OpenSHAPA
scripts through Datavyu.
