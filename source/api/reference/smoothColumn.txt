.. default-domain:: rb

.. method:: smoothColumn(colname, tol=33)

   Tweaks a variable's cells' onsets so that there is a maximum of
   ``tol`` milliseconds between each cell. If two cells are less than
   ``tol`` apart, it moves on to the next pair of cells; if there
   is a larger gap than ``tol``, the second cell's :term:`onset` is
   set to the first cell's :term:`offset`.

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 20, 40, 50
      :header-rows: 1
      
      * - Parameter
        - Type
        - Description
      * - ``colname``
        - String
        - Name of the column that you wish to modify.
      * - ``tol``
        - Integer
        - The tolerance you are willing to accept between a cell's
          :term:`offset` and the next cell's :term:`onset`. By default,
          this is 33ms.

   .. table-end
   
   .. admonition:: Returns
   
      Nothing. :meth:`smoothColumn` automatically writes its changes
      back to the database.

   .. admonition:: Example
   
      The following example checks the "trial" column's cells to ensure
      that a maximum of 50ms between a cell's :term:`offset` and the
      subsequent cell's :term:`onset`.
      
      .. code-block:: ruby
      
         require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
         begin
            smoothColumn("trial", 50)
         end
