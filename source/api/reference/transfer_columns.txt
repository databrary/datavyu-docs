.. default-domain:: rb

.. method:: transfer_columns(db1, db2, remove, *varnames)

   Transfers columns between spreadsheets. If db1 or db2 are set to the
   empty string "", then that spreadsheet is the current spreadsheet in $db
   (usually the GUI's spreadsheet). So if you want to transfer a column
   into the GUI, set db2 to "". If you want to tranfer a column from the
   GUI into a file, set db1 to "". 

   .. warning:: 
   
      Setting remove to true will DELETE THE COLUMNS YOU ARE
      TRANSFERRING FROM DB1.

      * - Parameter
        - Type
        - Description
      * - ``db1``
        - [path]   
        - The full path to save the first Datavyu file. Set to "" to use
          the spreadsheet that's currently open.
      * - ``db2``
        - [path]
        - The full path to save the second Datavyu file. Set to "" to
          use the spreadsheet that's currently open.
      * - ``remove``
        - Boolean
        - If true, Datavyu will delete the columns from ``db1`` as they
          are copied to ``db2``. False leaves the columns intact.
      * - ``varnames``
        - list of strings
        - List of the names of the columns that you wish to copy from
          ``db1`` to ``db1``. You must specify at least one column
          name.

   .. admonition:: Returns
   
      Nothing. Saves files in place or modifies the GUI.

   .. admonition:: Example
   
      The following example transfers the column "idchange" from
      test.opf to the GUI and leaves test.opf intact and unmodified.
         
      .. code-block:: ruby
            
         require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
         begin
            transfer_columns("/Users/username/Desktop/test.opf","",false,"idchange")
         end
