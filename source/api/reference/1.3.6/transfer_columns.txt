transfer_columns()
==================

.. default-domain:: rb

.. method:: transfer_columns(db1, db2, remove, *varnames)

   Transfers columns between spreadsheets. Replacing ``db1`` or ``db2`` with the
   empty string "", will refer instead to the currently open spreadsheet in Datavyu.

   Thus, if you want to transfer a column into the GUI, set ``db2`` to '',
   and specify the origin spreadsheet file as ``db1``. If you want to
   transfer a column from the GUI into a file, set ``db1`` to '', and set
   ``db2`` to that file's path.

   .. warning::

      Setting ``remove`` to ``TRUE`` will **DELETE THE COLUMNS YOU ARE
      TRANSFERRING FROM DB1**.

      * - Parameter
        - Type
        - Description
      * - ``db1``
        - String
        - The full path to save the first Datavyu file. Set to '' to use
          the spreadsheet that's currently open.
      * - ``db2``
        - String
        - The full path to save the second Datavyu file. Set to '' to
          use the spreadsheet that's currently open.
      * - ``remove``
        - Boolean
        - If ``TRUE``, Datavyu will delete the columns from ``db1`` as they
          are copied to ``db2``. ``FALSE`` leaves the columns intact.
      * - ``varnames``
        - list of strings
        - List of the names of the columns that you wish to copy from
          ``db1`` to ``db1``. You must specify at least one column
          name.

   .. admonition:: Returns

      Nothing. Saves files in place or modifies the GUI.

   .. admonition:: Example

      The following example transfers the column "idchange" from
      test.opf to the GUI and leaves test.opf intact and unmodified.

      .. code-block:: ruby
         begin
            sourceFile='/Users/datavyutester/Desktop/FileName1.opf'
            destinationFile='/Users/datavyutester/Desktop/FileName2.opf'
            columnsToTransfer = ['trial_rel', 'condition_rel']
            transferMyVariable(sourceFile, destinationFile, false, columnsToTransfer)
         end
