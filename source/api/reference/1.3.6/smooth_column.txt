.. default-domain:: py

.. function:: smooth_column(colname, tol = 33)

   Tweaks cell onsets so that there is a maximum of
   ``tol`` milliseconds between each cell. If two cells are less than
   ``tol`` apart, it moves on to the next pair of cells; if there
   is a larger gap than ``tol``, the second cell's :term:`onset` is
   set to the first cell's :term:`offset`.

   .. table-start

   .. tabularcolumns:: |l|L|L|

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 20, 40, 50
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Parameter
        - Type
        - Description
      * - ``colname``
        - String
        - Name of the column that you wish to modify.
      * - ``tol``
        - Integer
        - The tolerance you are willing to accept between a cell's
          :term:`offset` and the next cell's :term:`onset`. By default,
          this is 33ms.

   .. table-end

   .. admonition:: Returns

      Nothing. In addition, :meth:`smooth_column` automatically writes its changes
      back to the spreadsheet, so you do not need to write the changes
      using :meth:`setColumn`.

   .. admonition:: Example

      The following example checks the "trial" column's cells to ensure
      that a maximum of 50ms between a cell's :term:`offset` and the
      subsequent cell's :term:`onset`.

      .. code-block:: ruby

         require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
         begin
            smooth_column("trial", 50)
         end
