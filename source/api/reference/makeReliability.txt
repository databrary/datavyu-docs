.. method:: makeReliability(relname, column_to_copy, multiple_to_keep, *codes_to_keep)

   Creates a :term:`reliability column` that is a copy of another
   Datavyu column in the Database. :rb:meth:`makeReliability()` can
   copy the cells (or a subsection of the cells) and retain codes
   from the origin column if desired.

      * - Parameter
        - Type
        - Description
      * - ``relname``
        - String **or** Ruby column from :meth:`getColumn()`
        - the name of the new reliability column you will create. 
          The convention is to name it ``rel_columnName``, but you
          can name it whatever you want to.
      * - ``column_to_copy``
        - String
        - The name of the column that we want to create a reliability
          column *from* (i.e. the existing coded column).
      * - ``multiple_to_keep`` (**optional**)
        - Integer
        - Number of cells to skip: a value of ``2`` includes *every other
          cell* in the new variable; ``1`` includes every cell, and ``0``
          creates a blank column with no cells
      * - ``*codes_to_keep`` (**optional**)
        - comma-separated strings
        - Codes you want to copy from the original to new column.
          These are codes that the reliability coder will not have to
          code.

   .. admonition:: Returns

      A Ruby object representation of the reliability column within
      Datavyu.

   .. admonition:: Example

      The following example creates the reliability column "rel_trial"
      from the primary column "trial", copying every second cell, and retaining the
      "onset", "trialnum" and "unit" codes, and then writes the new
      "rel_trial" column back to the spreadsheet.

      .. code-block:: ruby
         
         require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
         begin
            rel_trial = makeReliability("rel_trial", "trial", 2, "onset", "trialnum", "unit")
            setVariable("rel_trial", rel_trial)
         end
