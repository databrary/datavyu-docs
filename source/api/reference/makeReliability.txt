makeReliability()

Definition
----------

.. code-block:: ruby

   makeReliability(relname, var_to_copy, multiple_to_keep, *args_to_keep)

*or the alias*

.. code-block:: ruby

   make_rel(relname, var_to_copy, multiple_to_keep, *args_to_keep)

Creates a "reliability variable" that is a copy of another Datavyu
variable in the Database. :function:`makeReliability()` can copy the
cells (or a subsection of the cells) and retain arguments from the
origin variable if wanted.

   * - Argument
     - Type
     - Description
   * - ``rename``
     - String **or** Ruby variable from :function:`getVariable`
     - the name of the new reliability variable you will create. The convention is to name it ``rel.variableName``.
   * - ``var_to_copy``
     - String
     - the name of the variable that we want to create a reliability variable *from* (i.e. the existing coded variable).
   * - ``multiple_to_keep``
     - Integer
     - number of cells to skip: a value of ``2`` includes *every other cell* in the new variable; ``1`` includes every cell, and ``0`` creates a blank column with no cells
   * - ``*args_to_keep``
     - comma-separated strings
     - Arguments you want to copy from the original to new variable. These are arguments that the reliability coder will not have to code

.. table-end

.. admonition:: Returns

   A Ruby object representation of the reliability variable within
   Datavyu.

Examples
--------

The following example creates the reliability variable "rel.trial"
from the primary variable "trial", copying every second cell, and retaining the
"onset", "trialnum" and "unit" arguments.

.. code-block:: ruby

   rel_trial = make_rel ("rel.trial", "trial", 2, "onset", "trialnum", "unit")
