Definition
----------

.. method:: makeReliability(relname, var_to_copy, multiple_to_keep, *args_to_keep)

.. TODO: mention that it has an alias in make_rel as well? 
   make_rel(relname, var_to_copy, multiple_to_keep, *args_to_keep)

Creates a :term:`reliability variable` that is a copy of another Datavyu
variable in the Database. :rb:meth:`makeReliability()` can copy the
cells (or a subsection of the cells) and retain arguments from the
origin variable if wanted.

   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description
   * - ``rename``
     - String **or** Ruby variable from :meth:`getVariable`
     - the name of the new reliability variable you will create. 
       The convention is to name it ``rel.variableName``.
   * - ``var_to_copy``
     - String
     - the name of the variable that we want to create a reliability
       variable *from* (i.e. the existing coded variable).
   * - ``multiple_to_keep`` (**optional**)
     - Integer
     - Number of cells to skip: a value of ``2`` includes *every other
       cell* in the new variable; ``1`` includes every cell, and ``0``
       creates a blank column with no cells
   * - ``*args_to_keep`` (**optional**)
     - comma-separated strings
     - Arguments you want to copy from the original to new variable.
       These are arguments that the reliability coder will not have to
       code

.. admonition:: Returns

   A Ruby object representation of the reliability variable within
   Datavyu.

Examples
--------

The following example creates the reliability variable "rel.trial"
from the primary variable "trial", copying every second cell, and retaining the
"onset", "trialnum" and "unit" arguments.

.. code-block:: ruby

   rel_trial = makeReliability("rel.trial", "trial", 2, "onset", "trialnum", "unit")
