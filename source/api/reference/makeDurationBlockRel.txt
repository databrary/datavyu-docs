.. default-domain:: rb

.. method:: makeDurationBlockRel(relname, var_to_copy, binding, block_dur, skip_blocks)

   Makes a duration-based reliability column. This creates two columns,
   one containing a cell with a number for that block, and another
   blank column for the free coding within the block.

      * - Parameter
        - Type
        - Description
      * - ``relname``
        - String
        - The name of the reliability column you are creating
      * - ``var_to_copy``
        - RVariable object
        - Name of the column which you are copying. The existing column
          that you are creating a reliability column from.
      * - ``binding``
        - String
        - Column to bind the copy to.
      * - ``block_dur``
        - Integer
        - Length the blocks should be (in milliseconds)
      * - ``skip_blocks``
        - Integer
        - Determines the amount of space that should be left between
          each coding block. ``skip_blocks`` is an Integer. Each skipped
          block is the length specified by ``block_dur``.
