makeDurationBlockRel()
======================

.. default-domain:: rb

.. method:: makeDurationBlockRel(relname, var_to_copy, binding, block_dur, skip_blocks)

   Makes a duration-based reliability column. This creates two columns,
   one containing a cell with a number for that block, and another
   blank column for the free coding within the block.

      * - Parameter
        - Type
        - Description
      * - ``relname``
        - String
        - The name of the reliability column you are creating
      * - ``var_to_copy``
        - RColumn object
        - Name of the column which you are copying, i.e.the existing column
          that you are creating a reliability column from.
      * - ``binding``
        - String
        - Column to bind the copy to.
      * - ``block_dur``
        - Integer
        - Length the blocks should be (in seconds)
      * - ``skip_blocks``
        - Integer
        - Determines the amount of space that should be left between
          each coding block. ``skip_blocks`` is an Integer. Each skipped
          block is the length specified by ``block_dur``. If
          ``block_dur`` is 10 seconds, and ``skip_blocks`` is 5,
          then 50 seconds will be left between each coding block.

   .. admonition:: Returns

      Nothing. Columns are automatically written to the spreadsheet.

   .. admonition:: Example

      The following example creates a duration-based reliability column
      from the "step" column.

      .. code-block:: ruby

         require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
