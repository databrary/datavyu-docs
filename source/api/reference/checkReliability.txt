.. default-domain:: rb

.. method:: checkReliability(main_col, rel_col, match_arg, time_tolerance, dump_file)

   Compares two Datavyu columns to check for reliability errors and
   accuracy.

      * - Parameter
        - Type
        - Description
      * - ``main_col``
        - String **or** Ruby variable from :meth:`getColumn()`
        - The primary column that ``rel_col`` will be compared against
      * - ``rel_col``
        - String **or** Ruby variable from :meth:`getColumn()`
        - The reliability column to compare to ``main_col``
      * - ``match_arg``
        - String     
        - The argument used to match the reliability cells to the primary
          cells. Must be a unique identifier between the cells.
      * - ``time_tolerance``
        - Integer
        - Amount of slack permitted, in milliseconds, between the two
          onset and offsets before it will be considered an error. Set to 0
          to tolerate no difference.
      * - ``dump_file`` (**optional**)
        - String path or Ruby File object
        - The full string path to dump the reliability output to. This can
          be used for multi-file dumps or just to keep a log. You can also
          give it a Ruby File object if a file is already started.

   .. admonition:: Returns

      Console and file output.

   .. admonition:: Example

      The following example checks the reliability column "rel_trial"
      against the primary column "trial", linking the two on their
      "trialnum" code, with a 100ms :term:`onset` and :term:`offset`
      difference tolerated.

      .. code-block:: ruby

         checkReliability("trial", "rel_trial", "trialnum", 100)

   .. admonition:: Example 

      The following example performs the same operation as the
      previous example, but also
      writes the output to ``~/Desktop/Relcheck.txt``,
      a text file.
   
      .. code-block:: ruby

         checkReliability("trial", "rel_trial", "trialnum", 100, "~/Desktop/Relcheck.txt")
