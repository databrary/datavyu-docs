.. method:: checkReliability(main_col, rel_col, match_arg, time_tolerance, dump_file)

Compares two Datavyu variables to check for reliability errors and
percent accuracy.

   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description
   * - ``main_col``
     - String **or** Ruby variable from :meth:`getVariable()`
     - The primary column that ``rel_col`` will be compared against
   * - ``rel_col``
     - String **or** Ruby variable from :meth:`getVariable()`
     - The reliability column to compare to ``main_col``
   * - ``match_arg``
     - String     
     - The argument to use to match the reliability cells to the primary
       cells. Must be a unique identifier between the cells.
   * - ``time_tolerance``
     - Integer
     - Amount of slack permitted, in milliseconds, between the two
       onset and offsets before it will be considered an error. Set to 0
       to tolerate no difference.
   * - ``dump_file`` (**optional**)
     - String path or Ruby File object
          - The full string path to dump the relability output to. This can
       be used for multi-file dumps or just to keep a log. You can also
       give it a Ruby File object if a file is already started.

   Console and file output.

Examples
--------

The following example checks the reliability variable "rel.trial"
against the primary variable "trial", linking the two on their
"trialnum" argument, with a 100ms :term:`onset` and :term:`offset`
difference tolerated.

.. code-block:: ruby

   checkReliability("trial", "rel.trial", "trialnum", 100)

The following example checks the reliability variable "rel.trial"
against the primary variable "trial", linking the two on their
"trialnum" argument, with a 100ms :term:`onset` and :term:`offset`
difference tolerated, and writes the output to the
``/Users/motoruser/Desktop/Relcheck.txt``, a text file.
   
.. code-block:: ruby

   checkReliability("trial", "rel.trial", "trialnum", 100, "/Users/motoruser/Desktop/Relcheck.txt")
