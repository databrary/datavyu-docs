=====================
The Datavyu Interface
=====================

When you first open Datavyu, you will see two windows: the
:guilabel:`Data Viewer Controller`, and a blank spreadsheet. If you add
a data source (e.g. an video or audio file or a motion capture file), a
third window containing the data source will appear. This is generally a
video that uses either Quicktime or VLC to play.

.. TODO: insert screenshots here

The following sections describe each component of the Datavyu interface
in detail.

Data Viewer Controller
----------------------

The Data Viewer Controller allows users to control the playback of their
data source and create observations in the spreadsheet. Quite literally, 
it controls the :guilabel:`Data Viewer`, the window that contains the
(video) data.

On the left side is the keypad. This section maps
directly to the number pad on your keyboard, or to an external number pad
if you keyboard does not have one. These keys control playback, and also
enable users to set :term:`cell onset` and :term:`cell offset`, create
new cells, find, and go back.

For more about the Data View Controller, and a detailed description of
its functionality and features, see :doc:`/guide/controller`.

Spreadsheet
-----------

The Datavyu spreadsheet is where users record comments, codes,
and interpretations of their data.

   top left, which you can use to add new :term:`variables <variable>`.

.. TODO: rewrite this dreadful paragraph

The spreadsheet is the core of Datavyu. By :ref:`configuring variables
<configure-variables>`, coders can record observations and link them
directly to timestamps in the data source. Each user-defined variable is
represented by a column in the spreadsheet, and observations stack on
top of each other in sequence. Looking horizontally across the
spreadsheet columns shows what was happening at a given point in time in
the data source. Looking vertically down a column shows the sequence
in which that variable type occurred.

The :doc:`/guide/spreadsheet` document describes the
:guilabel:`spreadsheet` in more detail.

   There are also a number of tutorials that can guide you through
   common operations and that can help you to configure your
   spreadsheet. See: :ref:`spreadsheet-tutorials` for a listing of
   pertinent tutorials.

Data Viewer
-----------

The :guilabel:`Data Viewer` is the window that contains/shows/presents
the :term:`data` (i.e. the audio, video, eye-tracking etc.).
