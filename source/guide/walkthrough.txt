=====================
The Datavyu Interface
=====================

When you first open Datavyu, you will see two windows: the
:guilabel:`Data Viewer Controller`, and a blank spreadsheet. If you add
a video (for example, by selecting the :guilabel:`Add Data...` button in
the :guilabel:`Data Viewer Controller`), a third window, a third window
containing the video will appear.

The following sections describe each component of the Datavyu interface
in detail.

Data Viewer Controller
----------------------

The Data Viewer Controller allows users to control the playback of their
data source and create observations in the spreadsheet.

On the left side is the keypad. This section maps
directly to the number pad on your keyboard, or to an external number pad
if you keyboard does not have one. These keys control playback, and also
enable users to set :term:`cell onset` and :term:`cell offset`, create
new cells, find, and go back.
