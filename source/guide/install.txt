Installation
============

Datavyu is a Java-based application, which is easy to install on Mac OS
X and Windows. The following sections describe Datavyu's system
requirements and then the installation process itself.

.. _datavyu-requirements:

Requirements
------------

Hardware Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The hardware requirements listed below are the minimum needed for Datavyu. More RAM
or a faster processor will improve Datavyu's performance, especially when
working with higher-resolution data sources.

- 4GB of RAM.
- 2.3 GHz processor.

You will also need enough disk space for your videos
and a keypad, either as part of your keyboard, or as an
external device.

Software Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Datavyu requires Java 1.6 or
higher. Many operating systems include Java by default, but if you
have *not* installed Java, you will need to do so.

The newest Mac build now has a built in version of Java. It no longer matters 
what version of Java is on your computer because Datavyu will use the one that 
it installs. 

Datavyu supports video playback through Quicktime.

.. note::

      If you are using Quicktime 7.7.5 or later, you will need to simply custom install Quicktime to include Java libraries in your version. The screenshot shows just how easy it is! Older versions of Quicktime can be typically installed.
      If you are on Windows 10, please download QuickTime version 7.7.6 `here <https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1822?locale=en_US>`_. Later versions of QuickTime will not work on Windows 10.

Install Datavyu
---------------

Mac OS X
~~~~~~~~

#. Before downloading Datavyu, please be sure that your security settings
   allow the installation of non-Mac applications. To change this
   permanently or temporarily go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy. 
   On the General Tab click the little lock in the lower left corner to unlock 
   the general preference pane. Then select "Anywhere" to allow Datavyu's installtion.

#. Download the latest Datavyu release for Mac OS X from the Datavyu
   website's `Downloads Page <http://datavyu.org/download/>`_.

#. You can drag this to your Applications folder, or some other
   preferred location on your computer.


Windows 
~~~~~~~

1. Download the latest Datavyu release for Windows from the Datavyu
   website's `Downloads Page <http://datavyu.org/download/>`_. Unless
   you've told Windows what to do with these types of files, a
   :guilabel:`File Download` window will pop up, prompting you to either
   Open the ``Datavyu-Windows-latest.zip`` file, or Save it. Either
   option is fine - you'll merely need to navigate to the folder after
   downloading if you choose to :guilabel:`Save` rather than choosing
   :guilabel:`Open`.

2. Unzip the program by opening the ``datavyu`` folder and
   double-clicking on ``datavyu``. A "Compressed (zipped) Folders
   Warning" will appear. Select :guilabel:`Extract all` to decompress
   the files.

3. Windows will run the Extraction Wizard. Follow the prompts and 
   extract the files. The Datavyu program is now available, but you
   need to install a video plugin before you can start using video
   with Datavyu.

4. Install a video plugin. At present, Datavyu for Windows does not
   include any video plugins. To use Datavyu, you **must** download
   Quicktime for Windows. If you already use Apple's iTunes, you
   likely already have Quicktime for Windows. Otherwise, you may
   download Quicktime for Windows from `Apple's website
   <http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/>`_.


.. _update-datavyu:

Keep Datavyu Up-to-Date
-----------------------

Every time you start Datavyu while connected to the Internet, it
checks to see if your version is the latest available. When a new
version is released, Datavyu will prompt you to download the latest
version.

You can also check if your Datavyu version is up to date by opening
the :guilabel:`Help` menu from the menu bar when the spreadsheet window is selected, 
and then selecting :guilabel:`Check for
updates...`.  If a new version is available, it will direct you to the
download page where you can download the latest release. Remember to replace your current
application with the latest version of Datavyu that you have just downloaded!

.. important::

   If you have found a workflow that works well for you, please do not update your Datavyu version. We suggest coding an entire study using the same Datavyu version. 

During the course of development, the Datavyu team releases several
*pre-release* versions of the software prior to releasing official
stable releases. Pre-releases may contain new features not yet
incorporated into the main software, but are also more likely to contain
bugs and to behave in unexpected ways. 

To be notified of pre-release updates, simply check the "pre-release"
checkbox in the updates window. Due to the increased potential for data
loss or bug-related issues, you should only choose to use pre-releases
if you need an unreleased feature, or are grappling with a bug in
the existing stable release that is fixed in the unstable release.

Ultimately, all new features in the pre-releases are brought together
and released as a new stable release.


Now that you have installed Datavyu, you can move on to Datavyu's
