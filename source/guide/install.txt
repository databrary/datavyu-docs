Installation
============

Datavyu is a Java-based application, which is easy to install on Mac OS
X and Windows. The following sections describe Datavyu's system
requirements and then the installation process itself.

.. _datavyu-requirements:

Requirements
------------

Hardware Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The hardware requirements listed below are the minimum needed for Datavyu. More RAM
or a faster processor will improve Datavyu's performance, especially when
working with higher-resolution data sources.

- 1GB of RAM.
- 1.2 GHz processor.

You will also need enough disk space for your videos
and a keypad, either as part of your keyboard, or as an
external device.

Software Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Datavyu requires Java 1.6 or
higher. Many operating systems include Java by default, but if you
have *not* installed Java, you will need to do so.

If you are using a Mac that does not
yet have Java installed, OS X will prompt you to install a Java IDE
when you first try to open Datavyu, or you can `download it directly from
Apple <http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572>`_.

On a Windows-based computer, you must also download Java. Go to
`java.com <http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp>`_ to download the latest
version for your operating system.

Datavyu supports video playback through Quicktime.

.. note::

      If you are using Quicktime 7.7.5 or later, you will need to simply custom install Quicktime to include Java libraries in your version. The screeshot shows just how easy it is! Older versions of Quicktime can be typically installed.

You may alternately
choose to use VLC for video playback, though this is not recommended. If
you wish to use VLC, you *must* use `version 2.0.1 <http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/2.0.1/macosx/vlc-2.0.1.dmg>`_,
as Datavyu does not currently support later versions.


Install Datavyu
---------------

Mac OS X
~~~~~~~~

   :alt: Mac OS X unzip installation window

#. Download the latest Datavyu release for Mac OS X from the Datavyu
   website's `Downloads Page <http://datavyu.org/download/>`_.

#. If your computer has not already done so, unzip the archive file
   (e.g. using Archive Utility). This will provide you with a folder
   containing the Datavyu software and associated support documents. You
   can drag this to your Applications folder, or some other
   preferred location on your computer.


Windows 
~~~~~~~

1. Download the latest Datavyu release for Windows from the Datavyu
   website's `Downloads Page <http://datavyu.org/download/>`_. Unless
   you've told Windows what to do with these types of files, a
   :guilabel:`File Download` window will pop up, prompting you to either
   Open the ``Datavyu-Windows-latest.zip`` file, or Save it. Either
   option is fine - you'll merely need to navigate to the folder after
   downloading if you choose to :guilabel:`Save` rather than choosing
   :guilabel:`Open`.

2. Unzip the program by opening the ``datavyu-1.0`` folder and
   double-clicking on ``datavyu-1.0``. A "Compressed (zipped) Folders
   Warning" will appear. Select :guilabel:`Extract all` to decompress
   the files.

   :align: center

3. Windows will run the Extraction Wizard. Follow the prompts and 
   extract the files. The Datavyu program is now available, but you
   need to install a video plugin before you can start using video
   with Datavyu.

4. Install a video plugin. At present, Datavyu for Windows does not
   include any video plugins. To use Datavyu, you **must** download
   Quicktime for Windows. If you already use Apple's iTunes, you
   likely already have Quicktime for Windows. Otherwise, you may
   download Quicktime for Windows from `Apple's website
   <http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/>`_.
   
.. note::
      
      If you are using Quicktime 7.7.5 or later, you will need to simply custom 
      install Quicktime to include Java libraries in your version. The screenshot
      shows just how easy it is! Older versions of Quicktime can be typically installed.

.. figure:: /img/install-quicktime-special.png

You can also use VLC for video playback. If you wish to use VLC, you
must use `version 2.0.1 for Windows <http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/2.0.1/win32/vlc-2.0.1-win32.exe>`_,
as Datavyu does not currently support later versions.

.. _update-datavyu:

Keep Datavyu Up-to-Date
-----------------------

Every time you start Datavyu while connected to the Internet, it
checks to see if your version is the latest available. When a new
version is released, Datavyu will prompt you to download the latest
version.

You can also check if your Datavyu version is up to date by opening
the :guilabel:`Help` menu from the menu bar when the spreadsheet window is selected, 
and then selecting :guilabel:`Check for
updates...`.  If a new version is available, it will direct you to the
download page where you can download the latest release. Remember to replace your current
application witht he latest version of Datavyu that you have just downloaded!

During the course of development, the Datavyu team releases several
*pre-release* versions of the software prior to releasing official
stable releases. Pre-releases may contain new features not yet
incorporated into the main software, but are also more likely to contain
bugs and to behave in unexpected ways. 

To be notified of pre-release updates, simply check the "pre-release"
checkbox in the updates window. Due to the increased potential for data
loss or bug-related issues, you should only choose to use pre-releases
if you need an unreleased feature, or are grappling with a bug in
the existing stable release that is fixed in the unstable release.

Ultimately, all new features in the pre-releases are brought together
and released as a new stable release.


Now that you have installed Datavyu, you can move on to Datavyu's
