Datavyu is a Java-based application, which is easy to install on Mac OS
X and Windows. The following sections describe Datavyu's system requirements and
then the installation process itself.

Requirements
------------

Hardware Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These hardware requirements are the minimum needed for Datavyu: more RAM
or a faster processor will improve Datavyu's performance, especially when
working with higher-resolution data sources.

- 1GB of RAM.
- 1.2 GHz processor.

You will also need enough disk space for the videos that you will be
working with, and a keypad, either as part of your keyboard, or as an
external device.

Software Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Datavyu requires Java 1.6 or
higher. Many operating systems include Java by default, but if you
have *not* installed Java, you will need to do so.

If you are using a Mac that does not
yet have Java installed, OS X will prompt you to install a Java IDE
when you first try to open Datavyu.

On a Windows-based computer, [words].

Install Datavyu
---------------

Mac OS X

#. Download the latest Datavyu release for Mac OS X from the Datavyu
   website's `Downloads Page <http://datavyu.org/download/>`_.

#. If your computer has not already done so, unzip the archive file
   (e.g. using Archive Utility). This will provide you with a folder
   containing the Datavyu software and associated support documents. You
   can drag this to your Applications folder, or some other
   easily-remembered location.

Out of the box, Datavyu
supports the Quicktime plugin for video playback. You may alternately
choose to use VLC for video playback, though this is not recommended. If
you wish to use VLC, you *must* use `version 2.0.1`_,
as Datavyu does not currently support later versions.

Windows 
~~~~~~~

#. Download the latest Datavyu release for Windows from the Datavyu
   website's `Downloads Page <http://datavyu.org/download/>`_.

#. [windows-specific installation instructions here once I figure out
   what they are]

#. Install a video plugin. At present, Datavyu for Windows does not
   include any video plugins. To use Datavyu, you **must** download
   Quicktime for Windows. If you already use Apple's iTunes, you
   likely already have Quicktime for Windows. Otherwise, you may
   download Quicktime for Windows from `Apple's website
   <http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/>`_.
   
You can also use VLC for video playback. If you wish to use VLC, you
must use `version 2.0.1`_,
as Datavyu does not currently support later versions.

Keep Datavyu Up-to-Date
-----------------------

Every time you start Datavyu while connected to the Internet, it
checks to see if your version is the latest available. When a new
version is released, Datavyu will prompt you to download the latest
version.

You can also check if your Datavyu version is up to date by opening
the :guilabel:`Help` menu, and then selecting :guilabel:`Check for
updates...`.  If a new version is available, it will direct you to the
download page to download the latest release.

During the course of development, the Datavyu team releases several
*pre-release* versions of the software prior to releasing the official
stable releases. Pre-releases may contain new features not yet
incorporated into the main software, but are also more likely to contain
bugs and to behave in unexpected ways. 

To be notified of pre-release updates, simply check the "pre-release"
checkbox in the updates window. Due to the increased potential for data
loss or bug-related issues, you should only choose to use pre-releases
if you need an as-yet unreleased feature, or are grappling with a bug in
the existing stable release that is fixed in the stable release.

Ultimately, all new features in the pre-releases are brought together
and released as a new stable release.


Now that you have installed Datavyu, you can move on to Datavyu's
