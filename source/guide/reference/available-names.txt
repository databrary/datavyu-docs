Naming Restrictions
===================

Datavyu places certain restrictions on code and column names:

- Column names **should not include periods**. 

- Column names must begin with a letter.

- The underscore is the **only** permitted special character.

- Datavyu also restricts certain names, making them unavailable for
  use. The following names cannot be used as a column or code name:

   -several.words.separated.by.periods
   -1stCharacterIsANumber
   -i_really_really_mean_it!!!!!!
