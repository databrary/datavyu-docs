   Data Viewer Controller
      [definition] see: :doc:`/guide/controller`

   data
      The audio or video files that are being studied.
   
   onset
   cell onset
      [definition]
   
   offset
   cell offset
      [definition]

   variable
      [definition]
   
   spreadsheet
      [definition] see: :doc:`/guide/spreadsheet`

   code
      To record observations about the data source.

   coder
      The human recording observations about the data source.

   playhead
      The playhead indicates the current point of playback in the
      :term:`timeslider` of the Data Viewer Controller.

   observation
      An instance of the :term:`variable` that is being coded.
      Observations have an :term:`onset` and an :term:`offset`, and
      may be [types].

   argument
      [define for Datavyu]
   
   Integer
      A whole number. Integers are numbers that are not fractions,
      and thus, which have no numbers after a decimal point.
   
   String
      In computing, a string is a linear sequence of characters. Strings
      can be random characters, words, or sentences.
   
   timeslider
      [define for Datavyu]

   key-value pair
      A data representation that pairs "keys" (some thing you have data
      about) with "values" (the data itself). A key-value pair could be
      "telephone" and "555-123-4567", for instance. Sometimes, values
      are represented as a list of values, or as an array.
   
   frame rate
      (from Wikipedia) "Frame rate (also known as frame frequency) is the
      frequency (rate) at which an imaging device produces unique
      consecutive images called frames". In other words, frame rate is the
      number of images shown per second. The three main frame rate
      standards are: 24p, 25p, and 30p.
      
   region
      [timeslider *region* explanation here]
   
   API 
      An API (Application Programming Interface) enables disparate software
      components to interact with each other by specifying functions or
      routines to perform tasks. Datavyu's API uses the 
      `Ruby <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/>`_ programming language.

   reliability variable
      A Datavyu variable that is a copy of an original variable
      used to ensure that the coded observations are accurate.

   matrix variable
      Matrix variables are :term:`key-value pairs <key-value pair>` that
      associate a variable name with a variety of :term:`arguments
      <argument>`. The attributes are themselves key-value pairs too.
      Matrix variables allow researchers to record components of events
      or phenomena together.

   text variable
      Text variables are a Datavyu variable type that supports free-form
      text entries, including paragraphs.
   
   nominal variable
      Nominal variables are variables whose values have no numerical
      value, such as gender or occupation. Nominal variables differ
      from :term:`text variables <text variable>` in that they do
      not allow multi-line entries.
