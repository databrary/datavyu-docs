   Data Viewer Controller
      [what is the dataviewer controller] see: :doc:`/guide/controller`

   data
      The audio or video files that are being studied.
   
   onset
   cell onset
      words
   
   offset
   cell offset 
      words

   variable
      [definition]
   
   spreadsheet
      [definition]

   code
      To record observations about the data source.

   coder
      The human recording observations about the data source.

   playhead
      The playhead indicates the current point of playback in the
      :term:`timeslider` of the Data Viewer Controller.

   observation
      An instance of the :term:`variable` that is being coded.
      Observations have an :term:`onset` and an :term:`offset`, and
      may be [types].

   argument
      [define for Datavyu]
   
   integer
      [define for Datavyu]
   
   string
      [define for Datavyu]
   
   timeslider
      [define for Datavyu]

   key-value pair
      [definition]
   
   frame rate
      (from Wikipedia) "Frame rate (also known as frame frequency) is the
      frequency (rate) at which an imaging device produces unique
      consecutive images called frames". In other words, it is the
      number of images shown per second. The three main frame rate
      standards are: 24p, 25p, and 30p.
      
   region
      [timeslider region explanation here]
   
   onset
   cell onset
      words

   offset
   cell offset 
      words

   code
      To record observations about the data source.

   coder
      The human recording observations about the data source.

   API 
      An API (Application Programming Interface) enables disparate software
      components to interact with each other by specifying functions or
      routines to perform tasks. Datavyu's API uses the 
      `Ruby <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/>`_ programming language.

   reliability variable
      A Datavyu variable that is largely a copy of an original variable
      used to ensure that the coded observations are accurate.
