   Data Viewer Controller
      The Data Viewer Controller is a core Datavyu window that enables
      you to control playback of data sources, and to record
      observations. See: :doc:`/guide/controller`

   data
      The audio or video files that are being studied.

   onset
   cell onset
      The start time of a cell. Each experiment should define how to
      define onsets in its :ref:`coding-manual`.

   offset
   cell offset
      The end time of a cell. Each experiment should define how to
      define onsets in its :ref:`coding-manual`.
 
   spreadsheet
      The core Datavyu window where coders record observations. See:
      :doc:`/guide/spreadsheet`

   playhead
      The playhead indicates the current point of playback in the
      :term:`timeslider` of the Data Viewer Controller.

   observation
      An instance of the :term:`column` that is being coded.

   code
      Datavyu codes are column components that researchers are observing.
      Each Datavyu :term:`column` may have multiple codes
      for which a coder will record observations. For instance, a
      column called "step", which refers to walking, might have
      a "foot" code that would differentiate between left or right
      feet, and a "direction" code that indicated if the person
      was stepping forward or backward.

   Integer
      A whole number. Integers are numbers that are not fractions,
      and thus, which have no numbers after a decimal point.

   String
      In computing, a string is a linear sequence of characters. Strings
      can be random characters, words, or sentences.

   timeslider
      The timeslider represents the length of the data source, and
      enables users to visualize where the :term:`playhead` is with
      respect to the entirety of the data source.

   key-value pair
      A data representation that pairs "keys" (some thing you have data
      about) with "values" (the data itself). A key-value pair could be
      "telephone" and "555-123-4567", for instance. Sometimes, values
      are represented as a list of values, or as an array.

   frame rate
      (from Wikipedia) "Frame rate (also known as frame frequency) is the
      frequency (rate) at which an imaging device produces unique
      consecutive images called frames". In other words, frame rate is the
      number of images shown per second. The three main frame rate
      standards are: 24p, 25p, and 30p.
      
   region
      The area of the :term:`timeslider` that has been brought into
      focus using the timeslider's brackets.

   API 
      An API (Application Programming Interface) enables disparate software
      components to interact with each other by specifying functions or
      routines to perform tasks. Datavyu's API uses the 
      `Ruby <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/>`_ programming language.

   reliability column
      A Datavyu column that is a copy of an original column
      used to ensure that the coded observations are accurate.

   column 
      Datavyu columns are phenomena or events that observations are
      collected about. Columns are :term:`key-value pairs <key-value
      pair>` that associate a column name with a variety of
      :term:`codes <code>`. Columns can be general, such as "trial" or
      "ID", or can be specific, such as "step" or "hand".  Datavyu
      represents columns as a column in the :guilabel:`Spreadsheet`.
   
   cell
      A cell is a graphical representation of an observation. Cells
      are rectangles that stack in the columns of Datavyu's 
      spreadsheet and contain the observation data that a coder 
      inputs when coding a data source.
    
   class
      A pre-defined object type, that has associated attributes and
      methods. See: :doc:`/api/overview`.

   method
      A defined action that you can perform. Methods may accept
      arguments in order to perform their specified tasks. 
      See: :doc:`/api/overview`.
   
   standalone method
      A :term:`method` that does not belong to a specific
      :term:`class`. See: :doc:`/api/overview`.
   
   script
      A program that performs a specific task.

   class method
      A :term:`method` that belongs to a :term:`class` and must be
      invoked on an instance of that :term:`class`. See:
      :doc:`/api/overview`.

   ordinal
      The position of a :term:`cell` within its :term:`column`. The
      ordinal is indicated in the top left corner of each cell in
      Datavyu.

   parameter
      The information that is methods use to perform their
      tasks. Paramateres can be required or optional.  See:
      :doc:`/api/overview`.

   argument
      The information the user specifies to a method for a given
      parameter. For instance, "charlie" might be the argument
      specified for the ``name`` parameter. See: :doc:`/api/overview`.
