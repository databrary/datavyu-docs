   Data Viewer Controller
      [definition] see: :doc:`/guide/controller`

   data
      The audio or video files that are being studied.
   
   onset
   cell onset
      [definition]
   
   offset
   cell offset
      [definition]

   column
      Datavyu columns are phenomena or events that observations are
      collected about. Columns can be general, such as
      "trial" or "ID", or can be specific, such as "step" or "hand".
      Datavyu represents columns as a column in the
      :guilabel:`Spreadsheet`.
   
   spreadsheet
      [definition] see: :doc:`/guide/spreadsheet`

   playhead
      The playhead indicates the current point of playback in the
      :term:`timeslider` of the Data Viewer Controller.

   observation
      An instance of the :term:`column` that is being coded.
      Observations have an :term:`onset` and an :term:`offset`, and
      may be [types].

   code
      Datavyu codes are column components that researchers are observing.
      Each Datavyu :term:`column` may have multiple codes
      for which a coder will record observations. For instance, a
      column called "step", which refers to walking, might have
      a "foot" code that would differentiate between left or right
      feet, and a "direction" code that indicated if the person
      was stepping forward or backward.
   
   Integer
      A whole number. Integers are numbers that are not fractions,
      and thus, which have no numbers after a decimal point.
   
   String
      In computing, a string is a linear sequence of characters. Strings
      can be random characters, words, or sentences.
   
   timeslider
      The timeslider represents the length of the data source, and
      enables users to visualize where the :term:`playhead` is with
      respect to the entirety of the data source.

   key-value pair
      A data representation that pairs "keys" (some thing you have data
      about) with "values" (the data itself). A key-value pair could be
      "telephone" and "555-123-4567", for instance. Sometimes, values
      are represented as a list of values, or as an array.
   
   frame rate
      (from Wikipedia) "Frame rate (also known as frame frequency) is the
      frequency (rate) at which an imaging device produces unique
      consecutive images called frames". In other words, frame rate is the
      number of images shown per second. The three main frame rate
      standards are: 24p, 25p, and 30p.
      
   region
      [timeslider *region* explanation here]
   
   API 
      An API (Application Programming Interface) enables disparate software
      components to interact with each other by specifying functions or
      routines to perform tasks. Datavyu's API uses the 
      `Ruby <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/>`_ programming language.

   reliability column
      A Datavyu column that is a copy of an original column
      used to ensure that the coded observations are accurate.

   matrix column
      Matrix columns are :term:`key-value pairs <key-value pair>` that
      associate a column name with a variety of :term:`codes
      <code>`. The argubments are themselves key-value pairs.
      Matrix columns allow researchers to record components of events
      or phenomena in one place.

   text column
      Text columns are a Datavyu column type that supports free-form
      text entries, including paragraphs.
   
   nominal column
      (from Wikipedia) "Nominal variables [columns] are columns whose values
      have no numerical value, such as gender or occupation." Nominal
      columns differ from :term:`text columns <text column>` in
      that they do not allow multi-line entries.
   
   cell
      A cell is a graphical representation of an observation. Cells
      are rectangles that stack in the columns of Datavyu's 
      spreadsheet and contain the observation data that a coder 
      inputs when coding a data source.
   
   class
      [words]

   method
      [words]
   
   standalone method
      A :term:`method` that does not belong to a specific :term:`class`.
   
   script
      [words]
   
   mutex
   mutexed
      [words]

   class method
      [words]
