Use Scripts to Automate Tasks
=============================

Datavyu provides a full suite Ruby scripting API to help you focus more
time on coding, and spend less time performing routine tasks.

The :doc:`Ruby API documentation </api>` guides you through writing
scripts and provides context to help you become an adept
Ruby script-writer regardless of your programming experience.
You can also watch a video version of this tutorial:

Run Scripts
-----------

Before you can run a script, you must write one. Refer to the
:doc:`Ruby API documentation </api>` for scripting help. 

#. Save your script as a ``.rb`` file, and put it somewhere you will be
   able to find again, such as a Scripts folder on your desktop, or the location
   where you store your Datavyu files.

#. In Datavyu, select the :guilabel:`Script` menu. The
   :guilabel:`Script` menu has two options: :guilabel:`Run script` and
   :guilabel:`Run recent script`.

#. Select :guilabel:`Run Script` to choose a script that you have saved
   on your hard drive. 
   
#. A file selection window will open. Navigate to the correct folder and
   choose the script you wish to run. 
   
#. The Datavyu **Scripting Console** will open and show you the progress
   of the script, or display any errors that arise. If Datavyu reports a script error,
   use the provided information to find it. 

#. You can close the Scripting Console when a notification that the script
   has been successfully run shows up. 

Scripts that you have recently run will be listed in the :guilabel:`Run Recent
Scripts` menu in the :guilabel:`Script` menu. This makes it easy
to repeatedly run the same scripts.
