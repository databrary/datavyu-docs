Add Cells
================

Datavyu represents events as :term:`cells <cell>` in the Datavyu
spreadsheet. Cells relate to :term:`columns <column>` because they capture the events, 
that you are coding in that pass. 

This tutorial assumes that you have already configured your spreadsheet
to include a column. If you have not already created a column in
your spreadsheet, start with the :ref:`guide-add-a-column` tutorial.

There are three ways to add cells to a Datavyu spreadsheet: using the
spreadsheet menu, using :guilabel:`Click to Create New Cell` in the body 
of the spreadsheet, or using keypad shortcuts. Keypad shortcuts are
ideal for creating cells while you code a video. Note that keypad shortcuts 
give you more options for how to insert cells and onset/offsettimes.

.. admonition:: Tip 

   Use the ``tab`` and ``shift-tab`` keyboard shortcuts or the arrow keys to easily
   navigate among codes within a cell.

Add Cells Directly in the Body of the Spreadsheet
--------------------------------------------

Adding observations (cells) to an existing variable (column) is simple:

#. Click in the gray :guilabel:`Click to create new observation` area.
   A new cell appears with the current playhead time as its :term:`onset`,
   and placeholders for any codes configured for the column.

#. Record appropriate values for your column's codes. For the
   "trial" column in the example spreadsheet, that means filling
   out the ``<trialnum>`` and ``<outcome>`` codes.

#. Set the cell :term:`offset` using the Data Viewer Controller or 
   your keypad.

Add Observations from Keypad
----------------------------

Adding observations using the keypad is even easier than doing so from
the spreadsheet:

#. Navigate to the point in the data source that you want to be the
   cell's :term:`onset`. Use the :guilabel:`create new cell and set
   onset` (``0``) key on the keypad to create a new cell and set its
   onset.
   
   **or**

   Create a new cell using the :guilabel:`create new cell` (``Enter``)
   key on the keypad, and then navigate to the :term:`onset` point in
   the data source, and set the cell onset using the 
   :guilabel:`set cell onset` (``clear``) key.

#. Record appropriate values for your column's codes. For the
   "trial" column in the example spreadsheet, that means filling
   out the ``<trialnum>`` and ``<outcome>`` codes.

#. Navigate to the offset point in the data source and set the cell
   :term:`offset` using the :guilabel:`set cell offset` key (``/`` or
   ``.``).
