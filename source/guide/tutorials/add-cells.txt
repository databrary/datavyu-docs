Add Cells
================

Datavyu represents events as :term:`cells <cell>` in the Datavyu
spreadsheet. Cells relate to :term:`columns <column>` because they capture the events 
that you are coding in that pass. 

This tutorial assumes that you have already configured your spreadsheet
to include a column. If you have not already created a column in
your spreadsheet, start with the :doc:`/guide/tutorials/add-a-column` tutorial.

There are three ways to add cells to a Datavyu spreadsheet: using the
spreadsheet menu, using :guilabel:`Click to Create New Cell` in the body 
of the spreadsheet, or using the Controller keypad. Controller keys are
ideal for creating cells while coding a video. Note that Controller keys 
give you more options for how to insert cells and onset/offset times.

.. admonition:: Tip 

   Use the ``tab`` and ``shift-tab`` keyboard shortcuts or the arrow keys to easily
   navigate among codes within a cell.

Add cells Using the Spreadsheet Menu
--------------------------------------------

Using the spreadsheet menu to add cells to an existing column is simple:

#. Click on the :guilabel:`Spreadsheet` menu and select :guilabel:`New Cell`. A new cell
   appears with the current play head time as its osnet and placeholders for any codes configured
   for the column. 
   
#. Set the cell offset using the Controller.

You can also add cells to neighboring columns by selecting :guilabel:`New Cell to Left` 
or :guilabel:`New Cell to Right`.


Add Cells Directly in the Body of the Spreadsheet
--------------------------------------------

Adding cells to an existing column is simple:

#. Click in the gray :guilabel:`Click To Create New Cell` area.
   A new cell appears with the current playhead time as its :term:`onset`
   and placeholders for any codes configured for the column.

#. Record appropriate values for the codes. For the
   "trial" column in the example spreadsheet, that means filling
   out the ``<trialnum>`` and ``<outcome>`` codes.

#. Set the cell :term:`offset` using the keypad on the Controller.

Add Cells from the Controller
----------------------------

Adding cells using the controller is even easier than doing so from
the spreadsheet:

#. Navigate to the point in the data source that you want to be the
   cell's :term:`onset`. Use the :guilabel:`new cell and set previous offset (``0``) 
   key on the keypad to create a new cell, set its onset based on your location in the data
   source, and set the previous cell's onffset to 1 ms prior all in one go. 
   
   
   **or**

   Create a new cell using the :guilabel:`new cell` (``Enter``)
   key on the keypad. The onset will reflect your location in the data source.
