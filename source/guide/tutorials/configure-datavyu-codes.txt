Configure Columns and Codes
===========================
  
Each column is a
collection of one or more :term:`codes <code>`. Each
code has a value that the coder inputs while coding a data
source.

Datavyu provides a Code Editor for configuring columns.  Check out our
video walkthrough of the Code
Editor's features:

The Code Editor window will open, and list all existing
columns. From here, you can add a new column, or edit
existing columns.

Add a Column
------------

Click on the :guilabel:`Add matrix()` button. A new column
called "matrix1" will appear in the list of columns. By default,
"matrix1" has one code, "code1".

You can change the name of the column or code by double-clicking
on its name and typing a new name.

Add Codes
---------

To add a code to a column, select the column. You'll know
you have selected it when its background is light blue. Then, click
on the :guilabel:`Add <code>` button.

You can change the name of the code by double-clicking on its name and
typing a new name. To reorder a column's codes, select the code by
clicking on it, and use the :guilabel:`Move <code>`
buttons to move it.

Rename Codes

To rename a code, open the Code Editor, and double click on the name
of the code you want to change, and type the new name. The spreadsheet
will update automatically.
