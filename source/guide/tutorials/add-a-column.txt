Datavyu represents sequences of events as columns in the
spreadsheet. 

Adding a column to your Datavyu project is simple. The following steps
will guide you through the process.

#. Open the Datavyu spreadsheet.

#. Click on the plus sign in the top left of the spreadsheet. The New
   Column window will open.

   .. TODO: add an image of the New Column window, and spreadsheet
      with plus sign.

#. Input a name for it.

#. Select :guilabel:`OK`. The column will be added to the spreadsheet.

You should now configure your column's codes. See:
:doc:`/guide/tutorials/configure-datavyu-codes` for more
information.
