Export Data from Datavyu
========================

Datavyu provides an integrated export tool for exporting Datavyu data.
To export your data, select the :guilabel:`File` menu, and then
select :guilabel:`Export File`. This outputs data to a CSV file that
has one column for every code in the spreadsheet: :term:`ordinal`,
:term:`onset`, and :term:`offset`, as well as user-configured codes.

   <source src="../../_static/video/export-thru-menu.mp4" type="video/mp4">
   </video>

If this format does not work for the analyses you need to perform, Datavyu supports 
Ruby scripting, which you can use to create a script that exports the data in your desired format. 

For a detailed guide to exporting data using Ruby scripts, see:
:doc:`/api/tutorials/export-data-using-scripts` in the Datavyu Ruby API
documentation.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/guide/tutorials/use-scripts-to-automate-tasks` for 
   instructions on running scripts within Datavyu.
