Export Data from Datavyu
========================

Datavyu provides an integrated export tool for exporting Datavyu data.
To export your data, select the :guilabel:`File` menu, and then
select :guilabel:`Export File`. This outputs data to a CSV file that
has one column for every code in the spreadsheet: :term:`ordinal`,
:term:`onset`, and :term:`offset`, as well as user-configured codes.

.. TODO: put an image of the sample output, alongside its download

If this format does not work for the analyses you need to perform, Datavyu supports 
Ruby scripting, which you can use to create a script that exports the data in your desired format. 

For a detailed guide to exporting data using Ruby scripts, see:
:doc:`/api/tutorials/export-data-using-scripts` in the Datavyu Ruby API
documentation.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/guide/tutorials/use-scripts-to-automate-tasks` for 
   instructions on running scripts within Datavyu.
