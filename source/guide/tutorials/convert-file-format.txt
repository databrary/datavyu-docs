Convert File Formats
====================

Datavyu currently supports video through QT and VLC.

If your data source is not directly supported by Datavyu, you
may be able to convert it to a readable format using Datavyu's Convert
Videos tool.

#. From the Spreadsheet, select the :guilabel:`Controller` menu,
   and then choose :guilabel:`Convert Videos`.

#. Select a source video. This will be the video you are converting.

#. Select a target video. This is the video that Datavyu will output
   or convert your source video into.
   
#. Select :guilabel:`Convert Video`, and your video will be converted.

For help with
data source conversion or other import issues, see `Datavyu's Support
site <http://datavyu.org/support/>`_.
