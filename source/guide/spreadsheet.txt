Spreadsheet Overview
====================

.. TODO: paragraph stolen from walkthrough.txt - you should make it not be.

The Datavyu Spreadsheet is where coders record
:term:`observations <observation>`. The spreadsheet is the core of Datavyu. By
:ref:`configuring columns <configure-columns>`, coders can record
observations and link them directly to timestamps in the data source.

Each user-defined column has its own column in the
spreadsheet. :term:`Cells <cell>` are column entries, boxes in the
column, where coders record their observation data as :term:`codes
<code>`. Cells stack on top of each other in sequence: looking
vertically down a column shows the sequence of observations for that
column. If you have enabled :ref:`temporal ordering
<temporal-ordering>`, Datavyu displays cells based on their
:term:`onset` and :term:`offset` times, allowing you to look
horizontally across the columns to see what occured at that point in
the data source.

   :guilabel:`plus` icon in the top right, which you use to add new
   :term:`columns <column>`.

Datavyu automatically links the times coded in the spreadsheet to the
current time in the data source. This allows coders to record
the :term:`onset` and :term:`offset` times of events into
the spreadsheet. Coders can also jump to the relevant time in the data source by
selecting a cell in the spreadsheet.

.. _columns:

Columns
-------

Datavyu supports three types of columns: *text*, *nominal*, and
*matrix*. Using combinations of these column types, you can [do stuff].
Each column that a user adds occupies its own column in the
spreadsheet.

Column Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Text Column
```````````

The *text column* is the more straightforward column type, being a
simple text field. Text columns are ideal for storing (information),
and (so on).

Here's a sample observation for a text column:

Nominal Columns
```````````````

.. next sentence stolen from wikipedia

*Nominal columns* are "columns with values which have no numerical
value, such as gender or occupation". These are useful for recording
facts about the study participant.

A typical nominal column might resemble the following:

.. TODO: example of a typical nominal column

Matrix Columns
``````````````

Matrix columns are key - value pairs, represented in the
following form: ::

   <columnname>(<arg01:N>, <arg02:N>, ... , <argn:N>)

Using the :ref:`Vocab Editor <vocab-editor>`, you can configure matrix
columns to represent any number of observations. They are the most
commonly-used column type.

Matrix columns have :term:`codes <code>`, which represent the
feature that is being studied. For instance, an argument could be "Left
hand touch", or "Hesitation", or "Focus". When a coder codes the data
source, he or she might record the presence or absence of these
arguments. A matrix column must have *at least* one argument, but may
have as many as desired. See: the :doc:`column configuration
</guide/tutorial/configure-datavyu-columns>` tutorial provides
instructions for configuring matrix columns.

.. _hide-show-columns:

Hide and Show Columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To hide a column, select the column by clicking on its name. Selected
column will have a blue background. You can select multiple columns by
Cmd-clicking (on Mac) or Ctrl-clicking (on Windows). Then, in the
:guilabel:`Spreadsheet` menu, select :guilabel:`Hide Selected
Columns`.

To show a column, select :guilabel:`Spreadsheet`, and then choose
:guilabel:`Show All Columns`.

You can also control a column's visibility form the :guilabel:`Column
List`, which you access from the :guilabel:`Spreadsheet` menu. The
:guilabel:`Column List` lists all the columns in a spreadsheet, and
includes a check box which you can use to toggle its visiblity.

.. _rearrange-columns:

Rearrange Columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To rearrange columns within the Spreadsheet, simply click the column's
name and drag it to the desired location.

Cells
-----

Cells are at the core of Datavyu: each cell represents an observation
recorded by the coder. 

Datavyu requires that each cell have three codes, in addition to any
user-specified codes:

- :term:`onset`: the onset is the time in the video that the
  observation begins. Since cells represent observations during a
  period of time, they must have a starting point.

- :term:`offset`: the offset is the time in the video that the
  observation ends. Since cells represnt observations during a period
  of time, they must have an end point.

- :term:`ordinal`: the cell ordinal indicates the position of the cell
  within the column. The first cell (the one with the earliest onset)
  would be number 1, the second number 2, and so on.

The following image indicates where each component is located within a
Datavyu cell.
