Spreadsheet Overview
====================


The Datavyu Spreadsheet is where coders record :term:`observations
<observation>`. The spreadsheet is the core of Datavyu. By
:doc:`/guide/tutorials/configure-datavyu-codes`, coders can record
observations and link them directly to timestamps in the data source.

For a brief introduction to some of the spreadsheet's components and
capabilities, watch the spreadsheet walkthrough video:

   <source src="../_static/video/edit-spreadsheet.webm" type="video/webm">
   </video>

Each user-defined column has its own column in the spreadsheet.
:term:`Cells <cell>` are column entries, boxes in the column, where
coders record their observation data as :term:`codes <code>`. Cells
follow each other in sequence: looking vertically down a column shows
the sequence of observations for that column. If you have enabled
:ref:`temporal-ordering`, Datavyu displays cells based on their
:term:`onset` and :term:`offset` times, to show what occurred at that
point in time in the data source.

   A typical Datavyu spreadsheet with an example of six columns. Note the
   :guilabel:`plus` icon in the top right, which you use to add new
   :term:`columns <column>`.

Datavyu automatically links the times coded in the spreadsheet to the
current time in the data source. This allows coders to record
the :term:`onset` and :term:`offset` times of events in
the spreadsheet. Coders can also jump to a relevant time in the data source by
selecting a specific cell in the spreadsheet and pressing find (+in the keyboard).

Columns
-------

Datavyu uses columns to group together related observations. In
general, coders will code the data source column-by-column meaning 
that they code one entire column before coding a new column.

Using the Code Editor, you can configure
columns to represent any number of observations.

.. TODO: image with new columns showing multiple codes per cell

Columns have :term:`codes <code>`, which represent the
feature that you are observing. For instance, a code could be "Left
hand touch", or "Smiling", or "Look left." When coding the data
source, coders can record the presence or absence of these
codes and/or potential values within them. Columns can have as many or as few codes as you want.
If you want to score durations without scoring codes, you can leave the default code
as is and ignore the <code01> prompt.


Also note that column names are limited to the letters of the aphabet, numbers and hte underscore symbol
(and numbers and underscores cannot be the first character of the name) to eliminate potential
confusion in scripting and SPSS analyses. The :doc:`column configuration
</guide/tutorials/configure-datavyu-codes>` tutorial provides
instructions for configuring columns.

.. _hide-show-columns:

Hide and Show Columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To hide a column, select the column by clicking on its name at the top of
the spreadsheet. Theselected column will have a blue background. 
You can select multiple columns by ``Cmd`` -clicking (on Mac) or
``Ctrl`` -clicking (on Windows). Then, in the
:guilabel:`Spreadsheet` menu, select :guilabel:`Hide Selected Columns`.

You can also control each column's visibility from the
:guilabel:`Column List`, which you access from the
:guilabel:`Spreadsheet` menu. The :guilabel:`Column List` shows all of
the columns in the current spreadsheet, and includes a checkbox, which you can
use to toggle its visibility.

If you wish to show all columns you can do so with the :guilabel:`Show
All Columns` menu option from the :guilabel:`Spreadsheet` menu.

.. _rearrange-columns:

Rearrange Columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To rearrange the order of columns within the spreadsheet, simply click the column's
name and drag it left or right to the desired location.

.. _cells:
.. _cell-explanation:

Cells
-----

Each cell represents an observation
scored by the coder. 

Minimaly, Datavyu displays three values for each cell, but you can ignore
one or all of these values and Datavyu will display the default.

- :term:`onset`: the time value displayed on the top left of the cell. 
  If you don’t code this value, the cell will display the default value of 0:00:00:000. 
  You can code a time value to mark the beginning of an event or to 
  tag the approximate time of an event. 

- :term:`offset`:the time value displayed on the top right of the cell. 
  If you don’t code this value, the cell will display the default value 
  of 0:00:00:000. You can code a time value to mark the end of an event 
  or to tag the approximate time of an event. 

- :term:`ordinal`: the cell ordinal indicates the position of the cell
  within the column. The first cell (the one with the earliest onset or 
  the first cell you code if you do not mark onsets)
  would be number 1, the second number 2, and so on. Ordinals are
  automatically coded and updated as you code your data source. You
  will never need to set the ordinal. 

The following image labels each component within a Datavyu cell.

Spreadsheet Customization
-------------------------

Datavyu allows you to modify the spreadsheet
by including options that you can activate or deactivate, depending on
your needs.

Zoom
~~~~

By default, the Datavyu spreadsheet uses one font size for the
user-input codes in cells. You can increase this font size by choosing
:guilabel:`Zoom` from the :guilabel:`Spreadsheet` menu. However, the font
size for the onset and offset times do not change.

You can also modify zoom using keyboard shortcuts:

- ``cmd +`` / ``alt +`` zooms in
- ``cmd -`` / ``alt -`` zooms out
- ``cmd 0`` / ``alt 0`` resets the zoom to the default level

.. _temporal-ordering:
.. _temporal-alignment:

Temporal Alignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Temporal alignment is an important feature of Datavyu. When temporal
alignment is active, Datavyu groups cells based on their onsets and
offsets, visually representing the period of time each cell occupies.
This Temporal Alignment video
highlights the differences between active and inactive temporal alignment:

.. raw:: html

   <video controls width="100%" height="auto">
   <source src="../_static/video/temporal-alignment.mp4" type="video/mp4">
   <source src="../_static/video/temporal-alignment.webm" type="video/webm">
   </video>

Temporal alignment allows you to visualize what occurred at what time,
and to compare event sequences across columns. When coding, you should
ensure that temporal alignment is active.

.. figure:: /img/temporal-alignment-comparison.png
   :alt: comparison of two identical spreadsheets, one of which has temporal alignment active, and the other with temporal alignment disabled
   :align: center

   At left is a spreadsheet with temporal alignment enabled; at right is
   the same spreadsheet with temporal alignment disabled. Note that the
   cells contain the same information, it is only their presentation
   changes. Note also that enabling temporal alignment makes it
   easier to code and alllows you to visualize the relative length of events 
   and their relations across columns.

Toggle Temporal Alignment
`````````````````````````

You can toggle temporal alignment using the ``cmd T``
keyboard shortcut, or by selecting :guilabel:`Temporal Alignment`
from the :guilabel:`Spreadsheet` menu.

We have provided a simple list of the major shortcuts used in the Datavyu Spreadsheet.
