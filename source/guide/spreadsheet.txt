Spreadsheet Overview
====================

.. TODO: paragraph stolen from walkthrough.txt - you should make it not be.

The Datavyu Spreadsheet is where coders record
:term:`observations <observation>`. The spreadsheet is the core of Datavyu. By
:ref:`configuring columns <configure-columns>`, coders can record
observations and link them directly to timestamps in the data source.

Each user-defined column has its own column in the
spreadsheet. :term:`Cells <cell>` are column entries, boxes in the
column, where coders record their observation data as :term:`codes
<code>`. Cells follow each other in sequence: looking
vertically down a column shows the sequence of observations for that
column. If you have enabled :ref:`temporal-ordering`, Datavyu displays
cells based on their :term:`onset` and :term:`offset` times, to show
what occurred at that point in time in the data source.

   :guilabel:`plus` icon in the top right, which you use to add new
   :term:`columns <column>`.

Datavyu automatically links the times coded in the spreadsheet to the
current time in the data source. This allows coders to record
the :term:`onset` and :term:`offset` times of events into
the spreadsheet. Coders can also jump to the relevant time in the data source by
selecting a cell in the spreadsheet.

.. _columns:

Columns
-------

Datavyu supports three types of columns: *text*, *nominal*, and
*matrix*. Using combinations of these column types, you can [do stuff].
Each column that a user adds occupies its own column in the
spreadsheet.

Column Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Text Column
```````````

The *text column* is the more straightforward column type, being a
simple text field. Text columns are ideal for storing (information),
and (so on).

Here's a sample observation for a text column:

.. TODO: example of a typical text column observation

Nominal Columns
```````````````

.. next sentence stolen from wikipedia

*Nominal columns* are "columns with values which have no numerical
value, such as gender or occupation". These are useful for recording
facts about the study participant.

A typical nominal column might resemble the following:

.. TODO: example of a typical nominal column

Matrix Columns
``````````````

Matrix columns are key - value pairs, represented in the
following form: ::

   <columnname>(<arg01:N>, <arg02:N>, ... , <argn:N>)

Using the :ref:`Vocab Editor <vocab-editor>`, you can configure matrix
columns to represent any number of observations. They are the most
commonly-used column type.

Matrix columns have :term:`codes <code>`, which represent the
feature that is being studied. For instance, an argument could be "Left
hand touch", or "Hesitation", or "Focus". When a coder codes the data
source, he or she might record the presence or absence of these
arguments. A matrix column must have *at least* one argument, but may
have as many as desired. See: the :doc:`column configuration
</guide/tutorial/configure-datavyu-columns>` tutorial provides
instructions for configuring matrix columns.

.. _hide-show-columns:

Hide and Show Columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To hide a column, select the column by clicking on its name. The
selected column will have a blue background. You can select multiple
columns by ``Cmd`` -clicking (on Mac) or ``Ctrl`` -clicking (on
Windows). Then, in the :guilabel:`Spreadsheet` menu, select
:guilabel:`Hide Selected Columns`.

You can also control each column's visibility from the
:guilabel:`Column List`, which you access from the
:guilabel:`Spreadsheet` menu. The :guilabel:`Column List` lists all
the columns in a spreadsheet, and includes a check box which you can
use to toggle its visiblity.

If you wish to show all columns you can do so with the :guilabel:`Show
All Columns` menu option from the :guilabel:`Spreadsheet` menu.

.. _rearrange-columns:

Rearrange Columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To rearrange columns within the Spreadsheet, simply click the column's
name and drag it to the desired location.

.. _cells:
.. _cell-explanation:

Cells
-----

Cells are at the core of Datavyu: each cell represents an observation
recorded by the coder. 

Datavyu requires that each cell have three codes, in addition to any
user-specified codes:

- :term:`onset`: the onset is the time in the video that the
  observation begins. Since cells represent observations during a
  period of time, they must have a starting point.

- :term:`offset`: the offset is the time in the video that the
  observation ends. Since cells represnt observations during a period
  of time, they must have an end point.

- :term:`ordinal`: the cell ordinal indicates the position of the cell
  within the column. The first cell (the one with the earliest onset)
  would be number 1, the second number 2, and so on. Ordinals are
  automatically coded and updated as you code your data source: you
  will never need to set the ordinal. Cell ordinals are useful for
  scripting and analysis.

The following image labels each component within a Datavyu cell.

Spreadsheet Customization
-------------------------

Datavyu allows you to modify the spreadsheet to better suit your needs
by including options that you can activate or deactivate, depending on
your interests.

Zoom
~~~~

By default, the Datavyu spreadsheet uses one font size for the
user-input codes in cells. You can increase this font size by choosing
:guilabel:`Zoom` from the :guilabel:`Spreadsheet` menu.

You can also modify zoom using keyboard shortcuts:

- ``cmd +`` zooms in
- ``cmd -`` zooms out
- ``cmd 0`` resets the zoom to the default level

.. _temporal-ordering:
.. _temporal-alignment:

Temporal Alignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Temporal alignment is an important concept in Datavyu. When temporal
alignment is active, Datavyu groups cells based on their
onsets and offsets, visually representing the period of time each cell
occupies.

Temporal alignment allows you to visualize what occurred at what time,
and to compare event sequence between columns. When coding, you should
ensure that temporal alignment is active.

.. figure:: /img/temporal-alignment-comparison.*
   :alt: comparison of two identical spreadsheets, one of which has temporal alignment active, and the other with temporal alignment disabled
   :align: center

   At left: a spreadsheet with temporal alignment enabled; at right:
   the same spreadsheet with temporal alignment disabled. Note that the
   cells contain the same information, it is just their presentation
   that changes. Note also that enabling temporal alignment makes it
   easier to understand the sequence of events between different columns.

Weak and Strong Temporal Alignment
`````````````````````````````````

Datavyu supports two types of temporal alignment: "weak" and
"strong". [Explain the difference once you know it].

Toggle Temporal Alignment
````````````````````````

You can toggle temporal alignment using the ``cmd T`` keyboard
shortcut, or by selecting :guilabel:`Weak Temporal Alignment` or
:guilabel:`Strong Temporal Alignment` from the :guilabel:`Spreadsheet`
menu.
