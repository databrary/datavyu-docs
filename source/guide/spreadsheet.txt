Spreadsheet Overview
====================

.. TODO: paragraph stolen from walkthrough.txt - you should make it not be.

The Datavyu Spreadsheet is where :term:`coders <coder>` record
:term:`observations <observation>`. The spreadsheet is the core of Datavyu. By
:ref:`configuring variables <configure-variables>`, coders can record
observations and link them directly to timestamps in the data source.
Each user-defined variable is represented by a column in the
spreadsheet, and observations stack on top of each other in sequence.
Looking horizontally across the spreadsheet columns shows what was
happening at a given point in time in the data source. Looking
vertically down a column shows the sequence in which that variable type
occurred.

   top left, which you can use to add new :term:`variables <variable>`.
   [More words here].

DataVyu automatically links the times coded in the spreadsheet to the
current time in the video or audio source. This allows coders to insert
the :term:`onsets <onset>` and :term:`offsets <offset>` of events into
the spreadsheet and jump to the relevant time in the data source by
selecting coded data in the spreadsheet.

Variable Types
--------------

Datavyu supports three types of variables: *text*, *nominal*, and
*matrix*. Using combinations of these variable types, you can (do stuff).
Each variable that a user adds occupies its own column in the spreadsheet.

Text Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The text variable is the more straightforward variable type, being a
simple text field. Text variables are ideal for storing (information),
and (so on).

Here's a sample observation for a text variable:

Nominal Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. next sentence stolen from wikipedia

Nominal variables are variables with values which have no numerical
value, such as gender or occupation. These are useful for recording
facts about the study participant.

A typical nominal variable column might resemble the following:

Matrix Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Matrix variables are key - value observations, represented in the
following form: ::

   <variablename>(<arg01:N>, <arg02:N>, ... , <argn:N>)

Using the :ref:`Vocab Editor <vocab-editor>`, you can configure matrix
variables to represent any number of things.

Matrix variables have :term:`arguments <argument>`, which represent the
feature that is being studied. For instance, an argument could be "Left
hand touch", or "Hesitation", or "Focus". When a coder codes the data
source, he or she might record the presence or absence of these
arguments. A matrix variable must have *at least* one argument, but may
have as desired.
