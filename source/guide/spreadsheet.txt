Spreadsheet Overview
====================

.. TODO: paragraph stolen from walkthrough.txt - you should make it not be.

The Datavyu Spreadsheet is where :term:`coders <coder>` record
:term:`observations <observation>`. The spreadsheet is the core of Datavyu. By
:ref:`configuring variables <configure-variables>`, coders can record
observations and link them directly to timestamps in the data source.
Each user-defined variable is represented by a column in the
spreadsheet, and observations stack on top of each other in sequence.
Looking horizontally across the spreadsheet columns shows what was
happening at a given point in time in the data source. Looking
vertically down a column shows the sequence in which that variable type
occurred.

   top left, which you use to add new :term:`variables <variable>`.

DataVyu automatically links the times coded in the spreadsheet to the
current time in the data source. This allows coders to insert
the :term:`onsets <onset>` and :term:`offsets <offset>` of events into
the spreadsheet and jump to the relevant time in the data source by
selecting coded data in the spreadsheet.

.. _variable-types:

Variable Types
--------------

Datavyu supports three types of variables: *text*, *nominal*, and
*matrix*. Using combinations of these variable types, you can [do stuff].
Each variable that a user adds occupies its own column in the spreadsheet.

Text Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *text variable* is the more straightforward variable type, being a
simple text field. Text variables are ideal for storing (information),
and (so on).

Here's a sample observation for a text variable:

Nominal Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. next sentence stolen from wikipedia

*Nominal variables* are variables with values which have no numerical
value, such as gender or occupation. These are useful for recording
facts about the study participant.

A typical nominal variable column might resemble the following:

Matrix Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Matrix variables are key - value pairs, represented in the
following form: ::

   <variablename>(<arg01:N>, <arg02:N>, ... , <argn:N>)

Using the :ref:`Vocab Editor <vocab-editor>`, you can configure matrix
variables to represent any number of observations.

Matrix variables have :term:`arguments <argument>`, which represent the
feature that is being studied. For instance, an argument could be "Left
hand touch", or "Hesitation", or "Focus". When a coder codes the data
source, he or she might record the presence or absence of these
arguments. A matrix variable must have *at least* one argument, but may
have as many as desired.

.. TODO: is there a limit on the number of arguments?
