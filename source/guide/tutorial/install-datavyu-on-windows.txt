==========================

Datavyu is a Java-based application, which is easy to install on
Windows. The following sections describe Datavyu's system requirements
and then the installation process itself.

Install Datavyu
---------------

#. Download the latest Datavyu release for Windows from the Datavyu
   website's `Downloads Page <http://datavyu.org/download/>`_.

#. [windows installation instructions here once I figure out what they 
   are]

#. Install a video plugin. At present, Datavyu for Windows does not
   include any video plugins. To use Datavyu, you must download either
   Quicktime, which is recommended, or VLC.

   To use Quicktime for playback, you must install Quicktime for Windows.
   If you already use Apple's iTunes, you likely already have Quicktime
   for Windows. Otherwise, you may download Quicktime for Windows
   from `Apple's website <http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/>`_.
   
   Alternately, you can use VLC for video playback. If you wish to use
   VLC, you must use `version 2.0.1
   <http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/2.0.1/win32/vlc-2.0.1-win32.exe>`_,
   as Datavyu does not currently support later versions.

Now that you have installed Datavyu and a video plugin, you can move on
to Datavyu's :doc:`Getting Started Guide </guide/getting-started>`.
