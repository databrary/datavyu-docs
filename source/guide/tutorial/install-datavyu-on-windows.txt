Install Datavyu
---------------

#. Download the latest Datavyu release for Windows from the Datavyu
   website's `Downloads Page <http://datavyu.org/download/>`_.

#. [windows installation instructions here once I figure out what they 
   are]

#. At present, Datavyu for Windows does not include any video plugins.
   To use Datavyu, you must download either Quicktime, which is
   recommended, or VLC.

   To use Quicktime for playback, you must install Quicktime for Windows.
   If you already use Apple's iTunes, you likely already have Quicktime
   for Windows. Otherwise, you may download Quicktime for Windows
   from `Apple's website <http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/>`_.
   
   Alternately, you can use VLC for video playback. If you wish to use
   VLC, you must use `version 2.0.1
   <http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/2.0.1/win32/vlc-2.0.1-win32.exe>`_,
   as Datavyu does not currently support later versions.

Now that you have installed Datavyu and a video plugin, you can move on
to Datavyu's :doc:`Getting Started Guide </guide/getting-started>`.
