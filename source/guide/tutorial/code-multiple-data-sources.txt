==================================
Code Multiple Data Sources at Once
==================================

With Datavyu, you can code multiple data sources in one spreadsheet. For
instance, if you have three different camera views of an experiment, you
can bring them together into Datavyu, and code them as one.

Adding multiple data sources is easy, but aligning them perfectly can
take some effort. The following sections guide you through the process.

Add Multiple Data Sources
-------------------------

To add multiple data sources, simply add a data source using the Data
Viewer Controller's ':guilabel:`Add Data` button. You can add as many
data sources as you want to.

Each data source will have its own line in the :guilabel:`tracks` area
of the Data Viewer Controller. You can select an individual data
source by clicking on its blue bar: when selected, the bar will turn
green.

Align Tracks
------------

In order to be able to code your multiple data sources, you need to
align them so that the times recorded in the spreadsheet are accurate
for all data sources.

You will need to locate an event in the experiment that you can use as
the basis to synchronize your sources. For example, if the lights
flashed during the experiment, you could align the tracks at that
point.

Align Tracks Manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To align your data sources, select one and drag it to align with the
other source. Increasing the zoom using the :guilabel:`slider bar` in
the Data Viewer Controller can give you more granular control, and
facilitate precise alignment.

When you have successfully aligned your tracks, select :guilabel:`Lock
All`. This prvents you from accidentally desynchronizing the
tracks. You can also lock a single track by clicking on its
:guilabel:`lock` icon. This can be helpful while syncrhonizing the tracks.

Align Tracks Using Bookmarks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also use bookmarks to help synchronize tracks. If you identify
a distinct synchronization point, navigate to that point in the first
track, and click the :guilabel:`Add Bookmark` button. This will create
a bookmark in that track.

Then, locate the same event in the other data source and bookmark
it. When you drag the tracks to align them, they will "snap" to align
the bookmarks, aligning the tracks based on the bookmarked event.

You can repeat this process with all the tracks that you need to
synchronize, and then select the :guilabel:`Lock All` button to lock
them in that arrangement.

Persistence
-----------

When working with multiple data sources, Datavyu saves the data source
synchronization and bookmarks when you save the spreadsheet. This way,
when you reopen the spreadsheet to do more coding, or to work with the
data, you will not need to resynchronize the data sources. This also
helps ensure consistency between coding passes, by making sure that
all time recordings are consistent.
