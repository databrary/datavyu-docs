Configure Columns with Datavyu's Vocab Editor
===============================================

.. HEADINGS: 
.. text
   ----
   Text columns are freeform text areas, and do not require  
   configuration. As with any column, you must set the :term:`onset`
   and :term:`offset`, but the remaining argument is a freeform text 
   field.
   
.. nominal
   -------
   It looks like they'll be configurable at some point since there's 
   the greyed-out option in the vocab editor... but not at present?
   
Matrix columns are the most configurable Datavyu columns, and the most
useful for multivariate analyses. Each cell of a matrix column is a
collection of key-value pairs called :term:`arguments <argument>`. Each
argument (the key) has a value that the coder inputs while coding a data
source.

Datavyu provides a :ref:`Vocab Editor <vocab-editor>` for configuring
matrix columns.

Open the Vocab Editor
---------------------

From the Data Viewer Controller, click on the :guilabel:`Spreadsheet`
menu, and then select :guilabel:`Vocab Editor`.

The Vocab Editor window will open, and list all existing matrix
columns. From here, you can add a new matrix column, or edit
existing columns.

Add a Matrix Column
-------------------

Click on the :guilabel:`Add matrix()` button. A new matrix column
called "matrix1" will appear in the list of columns. By default,
"matrix1" has one argument, "arg1".

You can change the name of the column or argument by double-clicking
on its name and typing a new name.

Add Arguments
-------------

To add an argument to a matrix column, select the column. You'll know
you have selected it when its background is light blue. Then, click
on the :guilabel:`Add <arg>` button.

You can change the name of the argument by double-clicking on its name
and typing a new name, and can reorder a column's arguments by
selecting an argument by clicking within its text, and using the
:guilabel:`Move <arg>` buttons.

Remove Arguments
----------------

To delete an argument, select it by clicking within its text, and then
click on the :guilabel:`Delete` button in the top right.
