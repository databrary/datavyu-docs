Configure Columns and Codes
===========================
  
Each column is a
collection of one or more :term:`codes <code>`. Each
code has a value that the coder inputs while coding a data
source.

Datavyu provides a Code Editor for configuring
matrix columns.

Open the Code Editor
--------------------

From the Data Viewer Controller, click on the :guilabel:`Spreadsheet`
menu, and then select :guilabel:`Code Editor`.

The Code Editor window will open, and list all existing
columns. From here, you can add a new column, or edit
existing columns.

Add a Column
------------

Click on the :guilabel:`Add matrix()` button. A new matrix column
called "matrix1" will appear in the list of columns. By default,
"matrix1" has one code, "code1".

You can change the name of the column or code by double-clicking
on its name and typing a new name.

To add an code to a matrix column, select the column. You'll know
you have selected it when its background is light blue. Then, click
on the :guilabel:`Add <code>` button.

You can change the name of the code by double-clicking on its name and
typing a new name. To reorder a column's codes, select the code by
clicking on it, and use the :guilabel:`Move <arg>`
buttons to move it.
