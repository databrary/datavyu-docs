Add a Data Source or Convert File Formats in Datavyu
====================================================

Datavyu is designed to work with video, audio, physiology, motion, or
eye tracking data. Datavyu supports most file formats that VLC or
Quicktime can play. 

.. To convert video file types, see: :ref:`convert-data-source-type`.

Providing you have adequate processing power and a
sufficiently strong graphics card, you should be able to work with
high-resolution video files without challenge.

Add a Data Source
-----------------

#. Click the :guilabel:`Add Dataâ€¦` button in the top left corner of the
   Data Viewer Controller.

#. A file selection window will open. Select the data file you will be
   coding.

#. If the data source is a video file, Datavyu will attempt to determine
   its :term:`frame rate`. If it is unable to determine the frame rate,
   it will ask you what the video's frame rate is. 
   
   Datavyu uses frame rate to optimize playback and to :ref:`job
   <playback-controls>`, so it is important that you set the correct
   frame rate.

Convert an Unsupported File Format
----------------------------------

.. TODO: I'm not sure that this is actually what the convert video
   tool does.

If your data source is of a type that Datavyu cannot play (such as
[list]), you may be able to convert it to a readable format using
Datavyu's Convert Videos tool. 

#. From the Spreadsheet, select the :guilabel:`Controller` menu,
   and then choose :guilabel:`Convert Videos`.

#. Select a source video. This will be the video you are converting,

#. Select a target video. This is the video that Datavyu will combine
   the source video with (?).
   
#. Select :guilabel:`Convert Video`, and your video will be converted.

Alternately, [other free tools], such as
[list] may be able to help you convert your data source. For help with
data source conversion or other import issues, see: `Datavyu's Support
site <http://datavyu.org/support/>`_.
