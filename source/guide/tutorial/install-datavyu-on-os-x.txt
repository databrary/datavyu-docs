Install Datavyu
---------------

#. Download the latest Datavyu release for Mac OS X from the Datavyu
   website's `Downloads Page <http://datavyu.org/download/>`_.

#. If your computer has not already done so, unzip the archive file
   (e.g. using Archive Utility). This will provide you with a folder
   containing the Datavyu software and associated support documents. You
   can drag this to your Applications folder, or some other
   easily-remembered location.

You're now ready to start using Datavyu! Out of the box, Datavyu
supports the Quicktime plugin for video playback. You may alternately
choose to use VLC for video playback, though this is not recommended. If
you wish to use VLC, you *must* use `version 2.0.1
<http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/2.0.1/macosx/vlc-2.0.1.dmg
>`_ as Datavyu does not currently support later versions.

Now that you've installed Datavyu, you can move on to Datavyu's
:doc:`Getting Started Guide </guide/getting-started>`.
