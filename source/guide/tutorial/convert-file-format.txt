Convert File Formats

Datavyu is designed to work with video, audio, physiology, motion, or
eye tracking data. Datavyu currently supports video through QT
and VLC. There are plans to develop plugins to support other
data sources, such as [atuheuat].

.. TODO: I'm not sure that this is actually what the convert video
   tool does.

If your data source is of a type that Datavyu cannot play directly,
(such as [list]), you may be able to convert it to a readable format using
Datavyu's Convert Videos tool. 

#. From the Spreadsheet, select the :guilabel:`Controller` menu,
   and then choose :guilabel:`Convert Videos`.

#. Select a source video. This will be the video you are converting,

#. Select a target video. This is the video that Datavyu will output
   or convert your source video into.
   
#. Select :guilabel:`Convert Video`, and your video will be converted.

Alternately, [other free tools], such as
[list] may be able to help you convert your data source. For help with
data source conversion or other import issues, see: `Datavyu's Support
site <http://datavyu.org/support/>`_.
