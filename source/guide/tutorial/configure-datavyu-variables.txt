Configure Variables in Using the Vocab Editor
=============================================

.. HEADINGS: 
.. text
   ----
   Text variables are freeform text areas, and do not require  
   configuration. As with any variable, you must set the :term:`onset`
   and :term:`offset`, but the remaining argument is a freeform text 
   field.
   
.. nominal
   -------
   It looks like they'll be configurable at some point since there's 
   the greyed-out option in the vocab editor... but not at present?
   
.. Matrix variables are the most configurable Datavyu variables, and the
   most useful for multivariate analyses. Each cell of a matrix variable 
   is a collection of key-value pairs called :term:`arguments`. Each    
   argument (the key) has a value that the coder inputs while coding a 
   data source.

.. The following sample spreadsheet shows two matrix variables, "ID" and
   "trial". "ID" has four attributes: subject, test date,
   birth date, and condition. "trial" has two attributes: trialnum and
   outcome.

Datavyu provides the :ref:`Vocab Editor <vocab-editor>`, for configuring
matrix variables.

#. Open the Vocab Editor. From the Data Viewer Controller, click on the
   :guilabel:`Spreadsheet` menu, and then select 
   :guilabel:`Vocab Editor`.

   The Vocab Editor window will open, and list all existing matrix
   variables.
