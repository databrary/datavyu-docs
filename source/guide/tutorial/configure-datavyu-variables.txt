Configure Variables with Datavyu's Vocab Editor
====================================--=========

.. HEADINGS: 
.. text
   ----
   Text variables are freeform text areas, and do not require  
   configuration. As with any variable, you must set the :term:`onset`
   and :term:`offset`, but the remaining argument is a freeform text 
   field.
   
.. nominal
   -------
   It looks like they'll be configurable at some point since there's 
   the greyed-out option in the vocab editor... but not at present?
   
Matrix variables are the most configurable Datavyu variables, and the
most useful for multivariate analyses. Each cell of a matrix variable is
a collection of key-value pairs called :term:`arguments`. Each argument
(the key) has a value that the coder inputs while coding a data source.

Datavyu provides a :ref:`Vocab Editor <vocab-editor>` for configuring
matrix variables.

Open the Vocab Editor
---------------------

From the Data Viewer Controller, click on the :guilabel:`Spreadsheet`
menu, and then select :guilabel:`Vocab Editor`.

The Vocab Editor window will open, and list all existing matrix
variables. From here, you can add a new matrix variable, or edit
existing variables.

Add a Matrix Variable
---------------------

Click on the :guilabel:`Add matrix()` button. A new matrix variable
called "matrix1" will appear in the list of variables. By default,
"matrix1" has one argument, "arg1".

You can change the name of the variable or argument by double-clicking
on its name and typing a new name.

Add Arguments
-------------

To add an argument to a matrix variable, select the variable. You'll know
you have selected it when its background is light blue. Then, click
on the :guilabel:`Add <arg>` button.

You can change the name of the argument by double-clicking on its name
and typing a new name, and can reorder a variable's arguments by
selecting an argument by clicking within its text, and using the
:guilabel:`Move <arg>` buttons.

Remove Arguments
----------------

To delete an argument, select it by clicking within its text, and then
click on the :guilabel:`Delete` button in the top right.
