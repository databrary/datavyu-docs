Convert MacSHAPA Files to Work in Datavyu
=========================================

MacSHAPA users can convert their files to the new Datavyu format using a
script. The following script converts a folder of MacSHAPA files to
Datavyu: be sure to edit the folders name and location to reflect the
location of your MacSHAPA files and where you want the script to place
the Datavyu files.

.. code-block:: rb

   require 'Datavyu_API.rb'
   begin

      # Edit this to match the directory containing your files.
      macshapa_folder = File.expand_path("~/Desktop/MacSHAPA/")
      macshapa_files = Dir.new(macshapa_folder)

      # Edit this to match where you want to save the openshapa folders.
      openshapa_folder = File.expand_path("~/Desktop/OpenSHAPA/")
      if (!File::directory?(openshapa_folder))
          Dir.mkdir(openshapa_folder) # Make this dir if it doesn't exist
      end

      for f in macshapa_files.each()
       # Filter out files we don't want
           if (f[0].chr != '.') # Filter out the hidden files like . and .. and .DSSTORE
               puts "Converting " + f
               # Load the file and don't draw it to the screen
               $db, proj = load_macshapa_db(macshapa_folder + '/' + f, false)
               puts "Saving file " + f + " as OpenSHAPA file."
               save_db(openshapa_folder + '/' + f + ".opf")
           end
      end
   end
