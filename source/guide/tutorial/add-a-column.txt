Add a Column
============

Datavyu represents columns as columns in the spreadsheet. Columns
are [stuff that is being studied]. Datavyu supports three column
types: :term:`text <text column>`, :term:`nominal <nominal column>`,
and :term:`matrix <matrix column>`. For detailed descriptions of each
type, see: :ref:`column-types`.

Adding a column to your Datavyu project is simple: the following steps
will guide you through the process.

.. talks about adding a column to
   datavyu, cross-reference with :ref:`column-types` and
   :doc:`/guide/tutorial/configure-datavyu-columns`

#. Open the Datavyu spreadsheet.

#. Click on the plus sign in the top left of the spreadsheet. The New
   Column window will open.

#. Select the column type and input a name for it. For a full
   description of the Datavyu column types, see: :ref:`column-types`.

#. Select :guilabel:`OK`. The column will be added to the spreadsheet.

If you have added a :term:`matrix column`, you should now configure
its arguments. See: :doc:`/guide/tutorial/configure-datavyu-columns`
for more information. :term:`Text <text column>` and :term:`nominal
<nominal column>` columns do not require additional configuration.
