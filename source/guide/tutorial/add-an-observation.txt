Add Observations
================

Datavyu represents observations as :term:`cells <cell>` in the Datavyu
spreadsheet. Cells relate to :term:`columns <column>`: the events,
phenomena, behaviors, or facts that you are studying. Cells always
include :term:`onset` and :term:`offset` metadata, but it is up to the
researcher to determine what other data to record for each study
variable.

This tutorial assumes that you have already configured your spreadsheet
to include a variable. If you have not already created a variable in
your spreadsheet, start with the :ref:`guide-add-a-column` tutorial.

There are two ways to add observations to a Datavyu spreadsheet: using the
spreadsheet itself, or using keypad shortcuts. Keypad shortcuts are
ideal for creating observations as you watch or listen to a data source,
while adding observations directly in the spreadsheet might be ideal for
overarching variables such as trial or participant identification.

Add Observations Directly in the Spreadsheet
--------------------------------------------

Adding observations (cells) to an existing variable (column) is simple:

#. Click in the grey :guilabel:`Click to create new observation` area.
   A new cell appears with the current playhead time as its :term:`onset`,
   and placeholders for any attributes configured for the variable.

#. Record appropriate values for your variable's attributes. For the
   "trial" variable in the example spreadsheet, that means filling
   out the ``<trialnum>`` and ``<outcome>`` attributes.

#. Set the cell :term:`offset` using the Data Viewer Controller or 
   your keypad.

Add Observations from Keypad
----------------------------

Adding observations using the keypad is even easier than doing so from
the spreadsheet:

#. Navigate to the point in the data source that you want to be the
   cell's :term:`onset`. Use the :guilabel:`create new cell and set onset` (``0``)
   key on the keypad to create a new cell and set the onset.
   
   **or**

   Create a new cell using the :guilabel:`create new cell` (``Enter``)
   key on the keypad, and then navigate to the :term:`onset` point in
   the data source, and set the cell onset using the 
   :guilabel:`set cell onset` (``clear``) key.

#. Record appropriate values for your variable's attributes. For the
   "trial" variable in the example spreadsheet, that means filling
   out the ``<trialnum>`` and ``<outcome>`` attributes.

#. Navigate to the offset point in the data source and set the cell
   :term:`offset` using the :guilabel:`set cell offset` key (``/`` or
   ``.``).
