========================
Export Data from Datavyu
========================

Datavyu provides an integrated export tool for exporting Datavyu data.
To export your data, select the :guilabel:`File` menu, and then
select :guilabel:`Export Fileâ€¦`. This outputs data in a CSV file
that mirrors the formatting of the Datavyu spreadsheet.

The CSV export, while useful for [stuff] is not ideally organized for
data analysis. For a more analyzable data export, Datavyu supports Ruby
and R scripting, which can produce far better data sets for statistical
analyses.

For a detailed guide to export dating using Ruby scripts, see:
:doc:`/api/tutorial/export-data-using-scripts` in the Datavyu Ruby API
documentation.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/guide/tutorial/use-scripts-to-automate-tasks` for 
   instructions on running scripts within Datavyu.
