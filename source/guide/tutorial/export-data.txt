Export Data from Datavyu
========================

Datavyu provides an integrated export tool for exporting Datavyu data.
To export your data, select the :guilabel:`File` menu, and then
select :guilabel:`Export Fileâ€¦`. This outputs data to a CSV file that
has one column for every code in the spreadsheet: :term:`ordinal`,
:term:`onset`, and :term:`offset`, as well as user-configured codes.



While useful for viewing the Datavyu spreadsheet in a spreadsheet
program such as Microsoft Excel, the CSV export is not ideally
organized for data analysis. Datavyu supports Ruby and R scripting,
which can produce far better data sets for statistical analyses.

For a detailed guide to export dating using Ruby scripts, see:
:doc:`/api/tutorial/export-data-using-scripts` in the Datavyu Ruby API
documentation.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/guide/tutorial/use-scripts-to-automate-tasks` for 
   instructions on running scripts within Datavyu.
