=============================
Add a Data Source in Dataview
=============================

[introductory words]

#. 

Adding an audio, video, or other data source to Datavyu is as easy as
clicking on the :guilabel:`Add Dataâ€¦` button in the Data Viewer
Controller, [or using a menu option if there is one].

Datavyu supports most file formats that VLC or Quicktime can play,
including hi-resolution videos. When you open a video file, Datavyu will
attempt to determine the video's :term:`frame rate`. If it is unable to
determine the frame rate from the video's metadata, it will prompt you
to pick the frame rate. Datavyu uses frame rate to optimize playback,
and to :ref:`jog <playback-controls>`, so it is important that you set
the correct frame rate.

If your data source is of a type that Datavyu cannot play (such as
[list]), you may be able to convert it to a readable format using
Datavyu's [conversion tool]. Alternately, [other free tools], such as
[list] may be able to help you convert your data source. For help with
data source conversion or other import issues, see: `Datavyu's Support
site <http://datavyu.org/support/>`_.
