Add a Variable
==============

Datavyu represents variables as columns in the spreadsheet. Variables
are [stuff that is being studied]. Datavyu supports three variable
types: :term:`text <text variable>`, :term:`nominal <nominal variable>`,
and :term:`matrix <matrix variable>`. For detailed descriptions of each
variable type, see: :ref:`variable-types`.

Adding a variable to your Datavyu project is simple: the following steps
will guide you through the process.

.. talks about adding a variable to
   datavyu, cross-reference with :ref:`variable-types` and
   :doc:`/guide/tutorial/configure-datavyu-variables`

#. Open the Datavyu spreadsheet.

#. Click on the plus sign in the top left of the spreadsheet. The New
   Variable window will open.

#. Select the variable type, either text, nominal, or matrix, and input
   a name for it. For a full description of the Datavyu variable types,
   see: :ref:`variable-types`.

#. Select :guilabel:`OK`. The variable will be added to the spreadsheet.

If you have added a :term:`matrix variable`, you should now configure
its arguments. See: :doc:`/guide/tutorial/configure-datavyu-variables`
for more information. :term:`Text <text variable>` and :term:`nominal
<nominal variable>` variables do not require additional configuration.
