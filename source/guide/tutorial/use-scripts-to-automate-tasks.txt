=============================
Use Scripts to Automate Tasks
=============================

Datavyu provides a full suite Ruby scripting API to help you focus more
time on coding, and less time performing routine tasks.

The :doc:`Ruby API documentation </api>` guides you though writing
scripts for Datavyu and provides context to help you become an adept
Ruby script-writer regardless of your programming experience (or lack
thereof). Before you can use scripts in Datavyu, you need to write some,
so refer to that documentation first, and then follow this tutorial
to start running your scripts.

Run Scripts
-----------

Before you can run a script, you must write one. Refer to the
:doc:`Ruby API documentation </api>` for scripting help. 

#. Save your script as a ``.rb`` file, and put it somewhere you will be
   able to find again, such as a Scripts folder on your desktop, or
   where you store your Datavyu files.

#. In Datavyu, select the :guilabel:`Script` menu. The
   :guilabel:`Script` menu has two options: :guilabel:`Run script` and
   :guilabel:`Run recent script`.

#. Select :guilabel:`Run Script` to choose a script that you have saved
   on your hard drive. 
   
#. A file selection window will open. Navigate to the correct folder and
   choose the script you wish to run. 
   
#. The Datavyu **Scripting Console** will open and show you the progress
   of the script, and display any errors that might arise. If you have
   an error in a script, this is a good place to start looking for 
   bugs.

#. When your script has completed, you can close the Scripting Console
   and start working with your data source.
