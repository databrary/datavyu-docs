Getting Started with Datavyu
============================

Datavyu is a powerful tool that enables behavioral researchers to record
observations from their video, audio, or other data sources for future
analysis. Designed by researchers for researchers, Datavyu provides an
intuitive interface for working with data sources and recording
observations, and includes :doc:`an API </api>` for more advanced data
manipulation.

The Datavyu Interface
---------------------

When you first open Datavyu, you will see two windows: the
:guilabel:`Data Viewer Controller`, and a blank spreadsheet. If you add
a data source (e.g. an audio or video file, or a motion capture file), a
third window containing the data source will appear.

The following sections describe each component of the Datavyu interface.

Data Viewer Controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Data Viewer Controller` allows users to control the
playback of their data source and create observations in the
spreadsheet. Quite literally, it controls the :guilabel:`Data Viewer`,
the window that contains the (audio or video) data.

On the left side is the keypad. This section maps directly to the number
pad on your keyboard, or to an external number pad if you keyboard does
not have one. These keys control playback, and also enable users to set
the :term:`cell onset` and :term:`cell offset`, create new cells and
navigate within the data source.

For more about the Data View Controller, and a detailed description of
its functionality and features, see :doc:`/guide/controller`.

Spreadsheet
~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Datavyu spreadsheet` is where users record
:term:`observations <observation>` from the data source.

   A blank Datavyu spreadsheet. Note the :guilabel:`plus` icon in the
   top left, which you can use to add new :term:`columns <column>`.

.. TODO: rewrite this dreadful paragraph

The spreadsheet is the core of Datavyu. By :ref:`configuring columns
<configure-columns>`, coders can record observations and link them
directly to timestamps in the data source. Each user-defined column is
represented by a column in the spreadsheet, and observations stack on
top of each other in sequence. Looking horizontally across the
spreadsheet columns shows what was happening at a given point in time in
the data source. Looking vertically down a column shows the sequence in
which that column type occurred.

The :doc:`/guide/spreadsheet` document describes the
:guilabel:`spreadsheet` in more detail.

.. There are also a number of tutorials that can guide you through
   common operations and help you to configure your spreadsheet. See:
   :ref:`tutorial-configure-spreadsheet` for a listing of pertinent
   tutorials.

Data Viewer
~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Data Viewer` is the window that presents the data
source, the audio or video file that the user is working with.

Add a Data Source
-----------------

Adding an audio, video, or other data source to Datavyu is as easy as
clicking on the :guilabel:`Add Dataâ€¦` button in the Data Viewer
Controller, [or using a menu option if there is one]. For a more
detailed overview of adding data sources, and advice on converting file
formats, see:
:doc:`/guide/tutorial/open-data-source-or-convert-file-format`.

Once you've added a data source, it's time to add columns, create
observations, or write scripts. The :ref:`Core Operations Tutorials
<guide-core-tutorials>` are there to guide you.
