Datavyu is a powerful tool that enables behavioral researchers to code
observations from their video for analysis. Designed by researchers for 
researchers, Datavyu provides an intuitive interface for working with data
sources and recording observations, and includes :doc:`an API </api>` 
for more advanced data manipulation.

The Datavyu Interface
---------------------

When you first open Datavyu, Datavyu will check if you have the latest
version. If there has been a new release, Datavyu will prompt you to
:ref:`update your version <update-datavyu>`.

When you launch Datavyu, you will see two windows: the
:guilabel:`Controller`, and a blank spreadsheet. If you add
a data source, a third window containing the data source will appear.

The following sections describe each component of the Datavyu interface.

Media Player

The :guilabel:`Media Player` is the window that presents the data
source that the user is working with.

Adding a video or other data source to Datavyu is as easy as
clicking on the :guilabel:`Add Data…` button in the
Controller. For a more
detailed overview of adding data sources see:
:ref:`add-data`.

Once you've added a data source, it's time to add columns, create
observations, and write scripts. The :ref:`tutorials
<guide-core-tutorials>` are there to guide you. 

Controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Controller` allows users to control the
playback of their data source and create observations in the
spreadsheet. Quite literally, it controls the :guilabel:`Media Player`,
the window that contains the video data.

The keypad can be found on the left side of the controller. This section maps directly to the
number pad on your keyboard, or to an external number pad if you
keyboard does not have one and you've connected one to your computer. 
These keys control playback, and also enable users to set the :term:`cell onset` and :term:`cell offset`,
create new cells and navigate within the data source. The
:guilabel:`Add Data...` button enables you to :ref:`add a data source
<add-data>`. 

For more about the Controller, and a detailed description of
its functionality and features, see :doc:`/guide/controller`.


Spreadsheet
~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Datavyu spreadsheet` is where users record
:term:`observations <observation>` from the data source.

   :align: center
   
   This spreadsheet has seven columns: "MomSpeech", "InfantSpeech",
   "MomObject", "BabyObject". Each column has numerous coded cells.

By :doc:`/guide/tutorials/configure-datavyu-codes`, 
coders can record observations and link them
directly to timestamps in the data source. Each user-defined column is
represented by a column in the spreadsheet, and observations within a column
are sorted in chronological sequence. Looking horizontally across the spreadsheet
columns shows what was happening at a given point in time in the data
source. Looking vertically down a column shows the sequence in which
the observations occurred.

The :doc:`/guide/spreadsheet` document describes the
:guilabel:`spreadsheet` in more detail.
