Datavyu is a powerful tool that enables behavioral researchers to record
observations from their video, audio, or other data sources for future
analysis. Designed by researchers for researchers, Datavyu provides an
intuitive interface for working with data sources and recording
observations, and includes :doc:`an API </api>` for more advanced data
manipulation.

The Datavyu Interface
---------------------

When you first open Datavyu, Datavyu will check if you have the latest
version. If there has been a new release, Datavyu will prompt you to
:ref:`update your version <update-datavyu>`.

When you launch Datavyu, you will see two windows: the
:guilabel:`Data Viewer Controller`, and a blank spreadsheet. If you add
a data source (e.g. an audio or video file, or a motion capture file), a
third window containing the data source will appear.

The following sections describe each component of the Datavyu interface.

Data Viewer
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. TODO: add image of data viewer with a video in it.

The :guilabel:`Data Viewer` is the window that presents the data
source, the audio or video file that the user is working with.

Adding an audio, video, or other data source to Datavyu is as easy as
clicking on the :guilabel:`Add Dataâ€¦` button in the Data Viewer
Controller, [or using a menu option if there is one]. For a more
detailed overview of adding data sources see:
:ref:`add-data`.

Once you've added a data source, it's time to add columns, create
observations, or write scripts. The :ref:`tutorials
<guide-core-tutorials>` are there to guide you. 

Data Viewer Controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Data Viewer Controller` allows users to control the
playback of their data source and create observations in the
spreadsheet. Quite literally, it controls the :guilabel:`Data Viewer`,
the window that contains the (audio or video) data.

On the left side is the keypad. This section maps directly to the
number pad on your keyboard, or to an external number pad if you
keyboard does not have one. These keys control playback, and also
enable users to set the :term:`cell onset` and :term:`cell offset`,
create new cells and navigate within the data source. The
:guilabel:`Add Data...` button enables you to :ref:`add a data source
<add-data>`. 

For more about the Data View Controller, and a detailed description of
its functionality and features, see :doc:`/guide/controller`.

Spreadsheet
~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Datavyu spreadsheet` is where users record
:term:`observations <observation>` from the data source.

.. figure:: /img/base-screenshot-MomBaby.png

   :align: center
   
   This spreadsheet has seven columns: "MomSpeech", "InfantSpeech",
   "MomObject", "BabyObject", "Notes", "BabyLocation", and
   "BabyObjectCount". Each column has numerous coded cells.

The spreadsheet is the core of Datavyu. By :ref:`configuring columns
<configure-columns>`, coders can record observations and link them
directly to timestamps in the data source. Each user-defined column is
represented by a column in the spreadsheet, and observations follow
each other in sequence. Looking horizontally across the spreadsheet
columns shows what was happening at a given point in time in the data
source. Looking vertically down a column shows the sequence in which
the codes occurred.

The :doc:`/guide/spreadsheet` document describes the
:guilabel:`spreadsheet` in more detail.
