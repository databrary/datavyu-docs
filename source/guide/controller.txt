   from intro page

The Data Viewer Controller allows users to control the playback of their
data source and create observations in the spreadsheet. Quite literally, 
it controls the :guilabel:`Data Viewer`, the window that contains the
(video) data.

The Data Viewer Controller's keypad maps directly to the number pad
on your keyboard or external keypad.

- play/pause (``2``): pauses playback. Pressing :guilabel:`play/pause` again resumes playback.

  down the :guilabel:`shuttle left` key to continually rewind. (?)

Timeslider
----------

The :guilabel:`Timeslider` denotes data source playback stuff. You can
control the scale of the :guilabel:`Timeslider` using the slider bar in
the top right. Moving it to the right shows a smaller scale, [words].
The red :term:`playhead` shows the current playback position, and the
green bracketing barriers indicate the :term:`onset` and :term:`offset`
positions for the current clip.

The :guilabel:`Timeslider` component of the Data Viewer Controller also
includes five buttons that control stuff:

- Lock All: [words]

- Add Bookmark: adds a bookmark at the playhead.

- Snap Region: [words]

- Clear Region: [words]

- Search (the :guilabel:`magnifying glass` icon): [words]
