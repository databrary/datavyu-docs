Data Viewer Controller Overview
===============================

The Data Viewer Controller enables users to manipulate the playback of 
their data source, and create new cells as they record their observations.

The Data Viewer Controller has two main areas: the keypad on the left,
which maps directly to your keypad, and the :guilabel:`Timeslider` on
the right, which represents the current playback position, and provides
additional functionality to control and customize playback.

The following sections describe the two areas in detail, and provide
a useful reference for working with the Data Viewer Controller.

Keypad
------

The Data Viewer Controller's keypad maps directly to the number pad
on your keyboard or external keypad: the on-screen representation
helps users remember what key performs what function. When a key on
the keypad is depressed, a visual indicator onscreen mirrors the
keystrokes.

.. note:: 

   The Data Viewer Controller maps playback controls to the keys of your
   keypad. The names of the keys shown on the Data Viewer Controller
   (e.g. ``clear``, ``*``, ``/`` as the top row) may not map directly to
   the name or ordering of keys on your keypad. Some keypads may
   have a ``Num Lock`` key rather than ``clear``, for instance; others
   transpose the ``*`` and ``/`` keys. Play around with your keypad
   and the Data Viewer Controller to verify the key bindings for your
   keypad.

Playback Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important:: 

   You cannot use the keypad for inputting numbers into Datavyu: it will
   only perform the actions described here.

- :guilabel:`jog left` (``1``): moves the playhead back one frame. If the
  :term:`frame rate` is not set, :guilabel:`jog` will move the playhead
  in one second increments.

- :guilabel:`play/pause` (``2``): pauses playback. Pressing
  :guilabel:`play/pause` again resumes playback. :guilabel:`play/pause`
  only works if :guilabel:`play` has first been pushed.

- :guilabel:`jog right` (``3``): moves the playhead forward one frame. If the
  :term:`frame rate` is not set, :guilabel:`jog` will move the playhead
  in one second increments.

- :guilabel:`shuttle left` (``4``): rewinds, initially at 1/32 of playback speed.
  Repeatedly pressing the :guilabel:`shuttle left` key increases the rewind
  speed to a maximum of 32 times playback speed.

- :guilabel:`stop` (``5``): stops playback.

- :guilabel:`shuttle right` (``6``): fast forwards initially at 1/32 of playback
  speed. Repeatedly pressing the :guilabel:`shuttle right` key increases
  the fast forward speed to a maximum of 32 times playback speed.

- :guilabel:`rewind` (``7``): rewinds at 32x playback speed.

- :guilabel:`play` (``8``): starts playback.

- :guilabel:`forward` (``9``): fast forwards at 32x playback speed.

Coding Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- :guilabel:`set cell onset` (``clear``): sets the :term:`onset` for the current
  observation / cell.

- :guilabel:`point cell` (``*``): creates a new cell whose :term:`onset` and
  :term:`offset` values are the playhead's current position

- :guilabel:`set cell offset` (``/`` and ``.``): sets the :term:`offset` for the
  current observation / cell

- :guilabel:`find `(``+``): moves the playhead to the :term:`onset` time of the the
  time that is shown in the box to the right of the :guilabel:`find`
  button. By default, this is the :term:`onset` time for the
  currently-selected cell. You can change the time by selecting that box
  and editing the value.

- :guilabel:`go back` (``-``): moves the playhead to the time shown in the box
  to the left of the :guilabel:`go back` button. You can change the 
  time by selecting that box and editing the value.

- :guilabel:`create new cell and set onset` (``0``): creates a new cell and sets its
  :term:`onset` to the playhead's current position.

- :guilabel:`create new cell` (``Enter``): creates a new cell (and sets its onset...)

Timeslider
----------

.. TODO: explain what regions are and how they work once you understand

The :guilabel:`Timeslider` denotes data source playback stuff. You can
control the scale of the :guilabel:`Timeslider` using the slider bar in
the top right. Moving it to the right shows a smaller scale, [words].
The red :term:`playhead` shows the current playback position.

You can choose to focus on a single region by moving the green bracketing
dividers. Datavyu will start playback from the leftmost bracket's position,
and stop at the rightmost bracket.

The :guilabel:`Timeslider` component of the Data Viewer Controller also
includes five buttons:

- :guilabel:`Lock All`: [use is currently unclear]

- :guilabel:`Add Bookmark`: adds a bookmark at the playhead.

- :guilabel:`Snap Region`: sets the :term:`region` to the length of the selected
  cell: the left bracket is placed at the cell's :term:`onset`, and the
  right bracket at the cell's :term:`offset`.

- :guilabel:`Clear Region`: removes the region delineators.

- :guilabel:`magnifying glass` icon: [use currently unclear]
